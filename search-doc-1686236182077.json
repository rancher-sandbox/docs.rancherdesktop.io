[{"title":"FAQ","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"1.6/faq","content":"FAQ This FAQ is a work in progress designed to answer the questions our users most frequently ask about Rancher Desktop. Q: Is Rancher Desktop a desktop version of Rancher?​ A: While Rancher and Rancher Desktop share the Rancher name, they do different things. Rancher Desktop is not Rancher on the Desktop. Rancher is a powerful solution to manage Kubernetes clusters. Rancher Desktop runs local Kubernetes and a container management platform. The two solutions complement each other. Q: Is there a Kubernetes Cluster Explorer available in Rancher Desktop?​ A: Yes, the Rancher Dashboard is included as a feature preview in the release 1.2.1. Invoke the dashboard by clicking on Dashboard option in the system tray menu. To learn more about Rancher Desktop, click here. To learn more about Rancher, click here. Q: Can I have Docker Desktop installed alongside Rancher Desktop?​ A: Yes, but they cannot be run at the same time as both Rancher Desktop and Docker Desktop use the same Docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock). Before starting one, be sure to stop the other first. Q: How can I perform a clean uninstall of Rancher Desktop?​ A: First, perform a Factory Reset, and then you will uninstall the app. The uninstall process varies based on the operating system. For more information, please refer here. Q: What support, if any, is available for DNS over VPN on Windows?​ A: An alternative DNS resolver for Windows has been implemented to address some of the VPN issues on Windows. It should support DNS lookup over VPN connections. It has to be enabled manually by editing an internal configuration file. Q: What does the &quot;WSL Integration&quot; tab do?​ A: This makes the Kubernetes configuration accessible in the displayed WSL distributions so that you can use commands such as kubectl to communicate with Kubernetes. Q: Where can I find detailed logs?​ A: Click on the Troubleshooting tab, then click on Show Logs. Q: How can I enable the dashboard for the Traefik ingress controller?​ A: The Traefik dashboard is not exposed by default, for security reasons. However, it is possible to expose the dashboard in multiple ways. For instance, you can use one of the two approaches shown below. Using port-forward to enable dashboard access​ kubectl port-forward -n kube-system $(kubectl -n kube-system get pods --selector &quot;app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik&quot; --output=name) 9000:9000 Visit http://127.0.0.1:9000/dashboard/ in your browser to view the Traefik dashboard. Using HelmChartConfig to enable dashboard access​ Copy the instructions below into a file, for example, expose-traefik.yaml apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: traefik namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- dashboard: enabled: true ports: traefik: expose: true # Avoid this in production deployments logs: access: enabled: true Run the command kubectl apply -f expose-traefik.yaml Visit http://127.0.0.1:9000/dashboard/ in your browser to view the Traefik dashboard. Q: How can I disable Traefik, and will doing so remove Traefik resources?​ A: Yes, you can disable Traefik in order to free up port 80 and 443 for alternate ingress configuration. Disabling Traefik will not delete existing resources. By default, the Enable Traefik feature is selected under Kubernetes Settings; uncheck this box to disable it. If you want to delete Traefik resources, click on Reset Kubernetes on the Kubernetes Settings panel of the UI. Q: Is there support for internal container port forwarding?​ A: Yes, support has been enabled again for this feature on Linux and macOS. Q: Does file sharing work similarly to Docker Desktop? Do I have to do any additional configuration to mount volumes to VMs?​ A: Currently, the following directories are shared by default: /Users/$USER on macOS, /home/$USER on Linux, and /tmp/rancher-desktop on both. For Windows, all files are automatically shared via WSL2. Q: Can containers reach back to host services via host.docker.internal?​ A: Yes. On Windows, you may need to create a firewall rule to allow communication between the host and the container. You can run below command in a privileged powershell to create the firewall rule. New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName &quot;WSL&quot; -Direction Inbound -InterfaceAlias &quot;vEthernet (WSL)&quot; -Action Allow Q: I don't need the Kubernetes cluster deployed by Rancher Desktop; how do I disable it to save resources?​ A: Kubernetes can be disabled to run just containerd or dockerd by itself for reduced resource consumption. By default, the Enable Kubernetes feature is selected under Kubernetes Settings; uncheck this box to disable it. Q: What's happening to the Kubernetes Image Manager (kim)?​ A: As of version 1.0 Kim is no longer shipped and has been replaced by nerdctl and the Docker CLI. Q: Running brew install rancher is failing with a It seems there is already a Binary at '/usr/local/bin/&lt;BINARY&gt;' error, why?​ A: If any of the Rancher Desktop supporting utilities (Helm, kubectl, nerdctl, docker) are already managed by Homebrew, then the installation fails due to how the Homebrew cask formula is defined. Installing using the Mac app will avoid this issue. Q: I installed nerdctl through the Arch User Repository, but it doesn't work with Rancher Desktop, why?​ A: For Rancher Desktop, nerdctl must run inside the VM and not on the host. The host version is just a shell wrapper to execute the command inside the VM. Q: The tools on the Support Utilities page are not installed and I see a Insufficient permission to manipulate /usr/local/bin error, how do I fix it?​ A: This occurs when you do not have ownership of /usr/local/bin. A long-term solution to improve the handling of permissions is in the works. In the meantime, a temporary workaround is to change ownership of /usr/local/bin by running sudo chown $USER /usr/local/bin. When you are able to write to the directory, Rancher Desktop is able to create the symlinks. From versions 1.3.0 and above, we no longer create symlinks in /usr/local/bin but in ~/.rd/bin and put that directory on the PATH instead, to avoid having to deal with write permissions to /usr/local/bin and file conflicts. We strongly recommend you to upgrade to the latest version of Rancher Desktop. Q: Is Cygwin compatible with Rancher Desktop?​ A: No, but there are plans to add compatibility. Q: How can I add Rancher Desktop to the startup programs list on Windows?​ A: On Windows, you can add a program to startup programs list in different ways. For example, you can use below steps. - Press Windows+R to open the Run dialog box. - Type `shell:startup` and then hit Enter to open the Startup folder. - Copy &quot;Rancher Desktop&quot; shortcut from Desktop and paste in Startup folder. - Restart your machine. Q: Where does Rancher Desktop actually put the data volumes?​ A: Windows:Open Run menu (Press Windows + R) and open the path provided below, depending on the active container runtime. dockerd(moby): \\\\wsl$\\rancher-desktop-data\\var\\lib\\docker\\volumes containerd: \\\\wsl$\\rancher-desktop-data\\var\\lib\\nerdctl\\dbb19c5e\\volumes\\&lt;namespace&gt; macOS &amp; Linux:Navigate to the path provided below in the (lima) VM, depending on the active container runtime.

See below for details. It is also recommended to have: 8 GB of memory4 CPU Additional resources may be required depending on the workloads you plan to run. Ensuring You Have Access to /dev/kvm​ On some distributions (Ubuntu 18.04 for example) the user has insufficient privileges to use /dev/kvm, which is required for Rancher Desktop. To check whether you have the required privileges, do: [ -r /dev/kvm ] &amp;&amp; [ -w /dev/kvm ] || echo 'insufficient privileges'  If it outputs insufficient privileges, you need to add your user to thekvm group. You can do this with: sudo usermod -a -G kvm &quot;$USER&quot;  Then reboot in order to make these changes take effect. pass Setup​ By default, Rancher Desktop uses pass to securely store credentials passed via docker login and nerdctl login. pass requires a small amount of setup if this is the first time it has been used on your machine. If you don't intend to use docker login or nerdctl login you don't have to set uppass - just remember that if you use them in the future, you must set it up or you will run into errors. Once Rancher Desktop is installed, you should create a GPG key. This will be used by pass to secure secrets. You can create a GPG key with: gpg --generate-key  The output should contain something like 8D818FB37A9279E341F01506ED96AD27A40C9C73. This is your key ID. You can then initialize pass by passing this key ID to it: pass init 8D818FB37A9279E341F01506ED96AD27A40C9C73  For more information on pass, please see its website. Traefik Port Binding Access​ Rancher Desktop makes use of Traefik as the default ingress controller. Users may run into a permission denied error after deploying Rancher Desktop due to restricted port access on the Traefik ingress. Most Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu 20.04) do not allow non-root users to listen on TCP and UDP ports below 1024. In order to allow Traefik to listen to privileged ports on the local host, please run the following command: sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80  After the command is run, all ports 80 and above will become unprivileged and Traefik will be able to successfully access said ports. To preserve this change across reboots as a custom kernel parameter setting, add the same command inside your /etc/sysctl.conf file.

"},{"title":"Existing Deployments​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Running When Offline","url":"1.6/how-to-guides/running-air-gapped#existing-deployments","content":"If Rancher Desktop has been installed on a machine initially with networked access, it can be run subsequently on that machine after network connectivity has been turned off. The main difference in core functionality is that the list of versions of Kubernetes available in drop-down menus is limited to those versions that have actually been downloaded and stored in the cache. There is a problem using the kubectl client, because of the kuberlr wrapper (Windows users should add the .exe suffix to each executable utility file). In this case, we're discussing a system that was initialized when connected to the internet, but we're about to take the machine offline for future use. Suppose there are three versions of k3s in the rancher-desktop cache. 1.24.3 1.21.14 1.19.16 But suppose that on this system we only ran kubectl when using versions 1.24.3 and 1.21.14. This means that the ~/.kuberlr/PLATFORM-ARCH/ directory ($env:HOMEDRIVE%\\$env:HOMEPATH/.kuberlr/windows-amd64 on Windows) will contain only two files: kubectl1.24.3 kubectl1.21.14 If we go offline and use the UI to switch to Kubernetes 1.19.16, when kubectl is run, the system will fail. The problem is that kubectl is an alias for kuberlr, which will try to download kubectl 1.19.16 and install it in the .kuberlr directory, but won't be able to access it. So in this case, it would be best to prepare a connected system for disconnecting by selecting each available version of Kubernetes currently in the cache, and running kubectl --context rancher-desktop cluster-info to ensure that an appropriate version of the kubectl client is installed. You could install versioned kubectls manually. This is covered in the next section.

There are two directories that need to be populated in order for Rancher Desktop to function off-line: The Cache Directory​ To populate a source disk (which we refer to here as %SOURCEDISK%, although it is probably some kind of removable medium like a USB thumb drive), you need the following files: k3s-versions.json -- this file is created by Rancher Desktop. It reads a raw JSON file from https://update.k3s.io/v1-release/channels and converts it into a different kind of JSON file. Currently there is no utility to do that conversion; the easiest way to get this file is to run Rancher Desktop on a connected system and save the CACHE/k3s-versions.json file (see below for where CACHE exists on different platforms).Tar archives of Kubernetes K3s images. These are listed at https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases. You'll want to download either the k3s-airgap-images-amd64.tar for AMD/Intel machines, k3s-airgap-images-arm64.tar for M1 machines, or the respective *.tar.zst compressed tarball if you are using k3s v1.26.1 and above. Finally you'll need to download the k3s executable for the selected version. For example, the following commands will let you work with K3s v1.24.3 build 1 offline: cd .../CACHE mkdir v1.24.3+k3s1 cd v1.24.3+k3s1 wget https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.24.3%2Bk3s1/k3s-airgap-images-amd64.tar wget https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.24.3%2Bk3s1/sha256sum-amd64.txt wget https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.24.3%2Bk3s1/k3s  WindowsmacOSLinux On Windows, the cache directory is at $env:HOMEDRIVE%\\$env:HOMEPATH\\AppData\\Local\\rancher-desktop\\cache\\k3s, and can be created with the command mkdir -Force $env:HOMEDRIVE%\\$env:HOMEPATH\\AppData\\Local\\rancher-desktop\\cache\\k3s Assuming you have some source media, you would also run the following commands to pre-populate the cache: copy-item -Force $env:SOURCEDISK\\k3s-versions.json $env:HOMEDRIVE%\\$env:HOMEPATH\\AppData\\Local\\rancher-desktop\\cache\\ copy-item -Recurse -Force $env:SOURCEDISK\\v&lt;MAJOR&gt;.&lt;MINOR&gt;.&lt;PATCH&gt;+k3s&lt;BUILD&gt; $env:HOMEDRIVE%\\$env:HOMEPATH\\AppData\\Local\\rancher-desktop\\cache\\k3s\\  The kuberlr Directory​ The location of this directory is more straightforward. On all platforms, it's at HOME/.kuberlr/PLATFORM-ARCH where: HOME is the home directory: usually $env:HOMEDRIVE%\\$env:HOMEPATH on Windows, and ~ or $HOME on macOS and Linux.PLATFORM is one of windows, linux, or darwin.ARCH is aarch64 on M1 machines, and amd64 everywhere else. To populate it, determine which versions of Kubernetes you'll be using, and download the appropriate executables from the internet. These would be in: WindowsmacOS &amp; Linux https://dl.k8s.io/VERSION/bin/PLATFORM/CPU/kubectl.exe Where: VERSION will have the form vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (like v1.22.1),PLATFORM will be one of darwin, linux, or windows,CPU will arm64 on M1 machines and amd64 everywhere else. For example, to get a kubectl for Windows that will work with Kubernetes v1.22, this Windows command-shell (not PowerShell) command will put it on the SOURCEDISK: wget -O %SOURCEDISK/kubectl1.22.1.exe https://dl.k8s.io/v1.22.1/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe  A Note on Versions​ Kubectl clients are guaranteed to work with servers that are running the same MAJOR version and differ in the MINOR version by at most 1. So for example, if your organization is working with Kubernetes versions v1.21.x, v1.22.x, and v1.23.x, for any patch-version of x, you would only need to install kubectl1.22.x in the .kuberlr directory. But if you copy a v1.24.x of Kubernetes into the CACHE directory, you'll need to ensure there's a compatible kubectl in the .kuberlr directory as well (any of v1.23.x, v1.24.x, or v1.25.x would suffice).

Skaffold handles the workflow for building, pushing, and deploying your application, and it provides building blocks for creating CI/CD pipelines. This enables you to focus on iterating on your application locally while Skaffold continuously deploys to your local or remote Kubernetes cluster. To learn more about Skaffold, refer to the project docs here. In order to demonstrate the steps to set up Skaffold with Rancher Desktop, a sample nodejs app example is provided within the Rancher Desktop docs repository here. Important: Skaffold only works with dockerd (Moby). Therefore, make sure to select your runtime as dockerd from the Kubernetes Settings panel in the Rancher Desktop UI. Visit https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/ to install Skaffold. Clone the Rancher Desktop docs repository and navigate to the express-sample in a terminal as follows: cd docs.rancherdesktop.io/assets/express-sample Run skaffold init. Per the Skaffold docs,skaffold init walks through your project directory and looks for any build configuration files such as Dockerfile, build.gradle/pom.xml, package.json, requirements.txt, or go.mod. We will select Dockerfile and package.json in our example. This will generate the initial configuration file that you can modify as needed. When prompted, select yes to write your config to skaffold.yaml. In your editor, review your app.js and manifests.yaml files. Note that in manifests.yaml, you will have a deployment config as well as a service config. It is only necessary to have 1 replica for testing purposes. Back in your terminal, you'll notice that you will have two options: skaffold run that lets you build and deploy, and skaffold dev that allows you to enter development mode with auto-redeploy. We will use skaffold dev in this example. As you will need to have push access to the image repository, you can either use your docker login, or you can set up a local registry: Docker HubLocal Registry Before running skaffold dev, use your docker login if you have a Docker Hub account. Then, in the files skaffold.yaml and manifests.yaml replace matamagu/express-sample for YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/express-sample as skaffold dev will push the built image to DockerHub. As you go through your development, Skaffold will detect any changes and will automatically go through the build and deployment process again. You will be able to see any changes reflected in the cluster.

Q: Why do I not see my WSL distro under Rancher Desktop's WSL Integration page?​ A: You are likely using a WSL 1 distro. Rancher Desktop supports only WSL 2 distros. You can convert your WSL 1 distro into a WSL 2 distro by running the command wsl --set-version &lt;distro-name&gt; 2. You can also run the command wsl --set-default-version 2 to set all the future distributions you might install to use WSL 2. Q: I do not see an entry for Rancher Desktop when running kubectl config get-contexts, where is it?​ A: Rancher Desktop places its configuration in the default location, ~/.kube/config, and uses that. Your KUBECONFIG environment variable may be set to look elsewhere for configuration files. Q: Rancher Desktop is stuck on Waiting for Kubernetes API, what do I do?​ A: The cause is hard to determine without additional information. Navigate to the Troubleshooting tab and use the button to access the logs. Then go to the Rancher Desktop GitHub page and file an issue with the logs attached. Q: I can no longer run docker compose after installing Rancher Desktop and uninstalling Docker Desktop, what happened?​ A: This was an issue related to earlier versions (prior to 1.1.0) of Rancher Desktop. Rancher Desktop version 1.1.0 and above comes bundled with docker-compose for you, and makes the cli plugins available at ~/.docker/cli-plugins. We strongly recommend you to be on the latest version of Rancher Desktop. If you still don't see docker-compose available then please file a bug on Github. Q: I'm using Homebrew to install Rancher Desktop, but brew install rancher-desktop is failing, why?​ A: Due to the Homebrew cask naming conventions, the -desktop suffix is dropped from the cask formula name. Use brew install rancher instead. Q: How do I fix permission denied errors when trying to use Docker on WSL?​ A: You need write-permission to access the docker socket. There are many ways to go about that, but this is one of the more common approaches. Using the Ubuntu WSL command-line: sudo groupadd docker sudo adduser $USER docker sudo chown root:docker /var/run/docker.sock sudo chmod g+w /var/run/docker.sock newgrp docker Q: How do I fix kubectl: command not found issue on Linux?​ A: By default, Rancher Desktop creates symlinks of kubectl, docker, helm and nerdctl binaries in the /home/&lt;user&gt;/.local/bin directory on Linux. To be able to call these commands directly from the console you may add the directory to your PATH environment variable by executing the following command in console and performing logout and login: echo &quot;export PATH=\\$PATH:/home/$(whoami)/.local/bin&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc Q: How do I fix FATA[0005] subnet 10.4.0.0/24 overlaps with other one on this address space when running a container using nerdctl run?​ A: You will see this error if there's a route rule with an IP address from a conflicting subnet on the Iptables. The conflicting routes could be either from the host network (bridge mode) or the Kubernetes network. A quick workaround to this issue is to shutdown WSL via the command wsl --shutdown. ⚠️ Please note that shutting down WSL will stop all other distros along with the rancher-desktop distro.","keywords":""},{"title":"Working with Containers","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"1.6/tutorials/working-with-containers","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Running Containers​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Working with Containers","url":"1.6/tutorials/working-with-containers#running-containers","content":"To run a container with the default bridge CNI network (10.4.0.0/24): nerdctldocker nerdctl run -it --rm alpine  To build an image using BuildKit: nerdctldocker nerdctl build -t foo /some-dockerfile-directory nerdctl run -it --rm foo  To build and send output to a local directory using BuiltKit: nerdctldocker nerdctl build -o type=local,dest=. /some-dockerfile-directory  "},{"title":"Docker Compose​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Working with Containers","url":"1.6/tutorials/working-with-containers#docker-compose","content":"Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. nerdctldocker The nerdctl-compose CLI is designed to be compatible with docker-compose: nerdctl compose up -d nerdctl compose down  "},{"title":"Exposing a Port​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Working with Containers","url":"1.6/tutorials/working-with-containers#exposing-a-port","content":"To expose port 8000 for a container: nerdctldocker nerdctl run -d -p 8000:80 nginx  You can then access the container via the browser here: http://localhost:8000/.

See below for details. It is also recommended to have: 8 GB of memory4 CPU Additional resources may be required depending on the workloads you plan to run. Ensuring You Have Access to /dev/kvm​ On some distributions (Ubuntu 18.04 for example) the user has insufficient privileges to use /dev/kvm, which is required for Rancher Desktop. To check whether you have the required privileges, do: [ -r /dev/kvm ] &amp;&amp; [ -w /dev/kvm ] || echo 'insufficient privileges'  If it outputs insufficient privileges, you need to add your user to thekvm group. You can do this with: sudo usermod -a -G kvm &quot;$USER&quot;  Then reboot in order to make these changes take effect. pass Setup​ By default, Rancher Desktop uses pass to securely store credentials passed via docker login and nerdctl login. pass requires a small amount of setup if this is the first time it has been used on your machine. If you don't intend to use docker login or nerdctl login you don't have to set uppass - just remember that if you use them in the future, you must set it up or you will run into errors. Once Rancher Desktop is installed, you should create a GPG key. This will be used by pass to secure secrets. You can create a GPG key with: gpg --generate-key  The output should contain something like 8D818FB37A9279E341F01506ED96AD27A40C9C73. This is your key ID. You can then initialize pass by passing this key ID to it: pass init 8D818FB37A9279E341F01506ED96AD27A40C9C73  For more information on pass, please see its website. Traefik Port Binding Access​ Rancher Desktop makes use of Traefik as the default ingress controller. Users may run into a permission denied error after deploying Rancher Desktop due to restricted port access on the Traefik ingress. Most Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu 20.04) do not allow non-root users to listen on TCP and UDP ports below 1024. In order to allow Traefik to listen to privileged ports on the local host, please run the following command: sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80  After the command is run, all ports 80 and above will become unprivileged and Traefik will be able to successfully access said ports. To preserve this change across reboots as a custom kernel parameter setting, add the same command inside your /etc/sysctl.conf file.

Q: Is Rancher Desktop a desktop version of Rancher?​ A: No. Rancher Desktop is not Rancher on the Desktop. While Rancher and Rancher Desktop share the Rancher name, they do different things. But, the two solutions do complement each other: Rancher is a complete software stack for managing multiple Kubernetes clusters across any infrastructure. Rancher Desktop provides container management and a Kubernetes instance on the desktop to support local development use cases. Q: Is there a Kubernetes Cluster Explorer available in Rancher Desktop?​ A: Yes, the Rancher Dashboard is included as a feature preview in the release 1.2.1. Invoke the dashboard by clicking on Dashboard option in the system tray menu. Learn more about Rancher Desktop. Learn more about Rancher. Q: Can I have Docker Desktop installed alongside Rancher Desktop?​ A: Yes, but they cannot be run at the same time as both Rancher Desktop and Docker Desktop use the same Docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock). Be sure to stop one before starting the other. Q: How can I perform a clean uninstall of Rancher Desktop?​ A: First, perform a Factory Reset, and then uninstall the app. The uninstall process varies based on the operating system. For more information, please refer here. Q: What support, if any, is available for DNS over VPN on Windows?​ A: An alternative DNS resolver for Windows has been implemented to address some of the VPN issues on Windows. It should support DNS lookup over VPN connections. It has to be enabled manually by editing an internal configuration file. Q: What does the &quot;WSL Integration&quot; tab do?​ A: This makes the Kubernetes configuration accessible in the displayed WSL distributions so that you can use commands such as kubectl to communicate with Kubernetes. Q: Where can I find detailed logs?​ A: Click on the Troubleshooting tab, then click on Show Logs. Q: How can I enable the dashboard for the Traefik ingress controller?​ A: For security reasons, the Traefik dashboard is not exposed by default. However, it is possible to expose the dashboard in multiple ways. For instance, you can use one of the two approaches shown below. Using port-forward to enable dashboard access​ kubectl port-forward -n kube-system $(kubectl -n kube-system get pods --selector &quot;app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik&quot; --output=name) 9000:9000 Visit http://127.0.0.1:9000/dashboard/ in your browser to view the Traefik dashboard. Using HelmChartConfig to enable dashboard access​ Copy the instructions below into a file, for example, expose-traefik.yaml apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: traefik namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- dashboard: enabled: true ports: traefik: expose: true # Avoid this in production deployments logs: access: enabled: true Run the command kubectl apply -f expose-traefik.yaml Visit http://127.0.0.1:9000/dashboard/ in your browser to view the Traefik dashboard. Q: Can I disable Traefik, and will doing so remove Traefik resources?​ A: Yes, you can disable Traefik in order to free up port 80 and 443 for alternate ingress configuration. Disabling Traefik will not delete existing resources. By default, the Enable Traefik feature is selected under Kubernetes Settings; uncheck this box to disable it. If you want to delete Traefik resources, click on Reset Kubernetes on the Kubernetes Settings panel of the UI. Q: Is there support for internal container port forwarding?​ A: Yes, support for this feature is available on all three platforms, Windows, Linux, and macOS, as of v1.1.0. Q: Does file sharing work similarly to Docker Desktop? Do I have to do any additional configuration to mount volumes to VMs?​ A: Currently, the following directories are shared by default: /Users/$USER on macOS, /home/$USER on Linux, and /tmp/rancher-desktop on both. For Windows, all files are automatically shared via WSL2. Standard Docker volumes that are not generally accessible from the host computer work out of the box. To access other directories on Linux/macOS, you will have to perform additional configuration. If you want to change the behavior of the mounts, that will also require additional configuration. Q: Can containers reach back to host services via host.docker.internal?​ A: Yes. On Windows, you may need to create a firewall rule to allow communication between the host and the container. You can run below command in a privileged powershell to create the firewall rule. New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName &quot;WSL&quot; -Direction Inbound -InterfaceAlias &quot;vEthernet (WSL)&quot; -Action Allow Q: I don't need the Kubernetes cluster deployed by Rancher Desktop; how do I disable it to save resources?​ A: Open Rancher Desktop settings, click the cog to open Preferences, select Kuberentes, uncheck Enable Kubernetes feature is selected under Kubernetes Settings; uncheck this box to disable it. This will allow you to run just containerd or dockerd by without allocating resources for Kubernetes. Q: What's happening to the Kubernetes Image Manager (kim)?​ A: As of version 1.0, Kim is no longer shipped and has been replaced by nerdctl and the Docker CLI. Q: Running brew install rancher is failing with a It seems there is already a Binary at '/usr/local/bin/&lt;BINARY&gt;' error, why?​ A: If any of the Rancher Desktop supporting utilities (Helm, kubectl, nerdctl, docker) are already managed by Homebrew, then the installation fails due to how the Homebrew cask formula is defined. Installing using the Mac app will avoid this issue. Q: I installed nerdctl through the Arch User Repository, but it doesn't work with Rancher Desktop, why?​ A: For Rancher Desktop, nerdctl must run inside the VM and not on the host. The host version distributed with Rancher Desktop is just a shell wrapper to execute the command inside the VM. Q: The tools on the Support Utilities page (in Rancher Desktop &lt;1.3.0) are not installed and I see an Insufficient permission to manipulate /usr/local/bin error, how do I fix it?​ A: This occurs when you do not have ownership of /usr/local/bin. A long-term solution to improve the handling of permissions is in the works. In the meantime, a temporary workaround is to change ownership of /usr/local/bin by running sudo chown $USER /usr/local/bin. When you are able to write to the directory, Rancher Desktop should be able to create the symlinks. From versions 1.3.0 and above, we no longer create symlinks in /usr/local/bin but in ~/.rd/bin and put that directory on the PATH instead, to avoid having to deal with write permissions to /usr/local/bin and file conflicts. We strongly recommend you to upgrade to the latest version of Rancher Desktop. Q: Is Cygwin compatible with Rancher Desktop?​ A: No, but there are plans to add compatibility. Q: How can I add Rancher Desktop to the startup programs list on Windows?​ A: On Windows, you can add a program to startup programs list in a number of ways. For example, you can use the following steps. Press Windows+R to open the Run dialog box.Type shell:startup and then hit Enter to open the Startup folder.Copy &quot;Rancher Desktop&quot; shortcut from Desktop and paste in Startup folder.Restart your machine. Q: Where does Rancher Desktop actually put the data volumes?​ A: Windows:Open Run menu (Press Windows + R) and open the path provided below, depending on the active container runtime. dockerd(moby): \\\\wsl$\\rancher-desktop-data\\var\\lib\\docker\\volumes containerd: \\\\wsl$\\rancher-desktop-data\\var\\lib\\nerdctl\\dbb19c5e\\volumes\\&lt;namespace&gt; macOS &amp; Linux:Navigate to the path provided below in the (lima) VM, depending on the active container runtime. You can use rdctl shell to access these paths in the VM. dockerd(moby): /var/lib/docker/volumes containerd: /var/lib/nerdctl/dbb19c5e/volumes/&lt;namespace&gt; Q: How can I downgrade Rancher Desktop to a non-current (older) release version​ A: We strongly recommend you use the current release version as it has the latest features and bug fixes included. However, if you want to downgrade to an earlier version, please follow the steps below. Perform Troubleshooting &gt; Factory Reset from the current installation. Please make sure the Keep cached Kubernetes images box is not checked in the Factory Reset pop up dialog.Uninstall the current version by following uninstallation instructions for your OS.Install the older version that you need.","keywords":""},{"title":"Create a Multi-Node Cluster with k3d","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"1.7/how-to-guides/create-multi-node-cluster","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Steps to spin up a multi-node cluster​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Create a Multi-Node Cluster with k3d","url":"1.7/how-to-guides/create-multi-node-cluster#steps-to-spin-up-a-multi-node-cluster","content":"Make sure dockerd(moby) is selected as the Container Runtime in the Kubernetes Settings page.

"},{"title":"Existing Deployments​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Running When Offline","url":"1.7/how-to-guides/running-air-gapped#existing-deployments","content":"If Rancher Desktop has been installed on a machine initially with networked access, it can be run subsequently on that machine after network connectivity has been turned off. The main difference in core functionality is that the list of versions of Kubernetes available in drop-down menus is limited to those versions that have actually been downloaded and stored in the cache. There is a problem using the kubectl client, because of the kuberlr wrapper (Windows users should add the .exe suffix to each executable utility file). In this case, we're discussing a system that was initialized when connected to the internet, but we're about to take the machine offline for future use. Suppose there are three versions of k3s in the rancher-desktop cache. 1.24.3 1.21.14 1.19.16 But suppose that on this system we only ran kubectl when using versions 1.24.3 and 1.21.14. This means that the ~/.kuberlr/PLATFORM-ARCH/ directory ($env:HOMEDRIVE%\\$env:HOMEPATH/.kuberlr/windows-amd64 on Windows) will contain only two files: kubectl1.24.3 kubectl1.21.14 If we go offline and use the UI to switch to Kubernetes 1.19.16, when kubectl is run, the system will fail. The problem is that kubectl is an alias for kuberlr, which will try to download kubectl 1.19.16 and install it in the .kuberlr directory, but won't be able to access it. So in this case, it would be best to prepare a connected system for disconnecting by selecting each available version of Kubernetes currently in the cache, and running kubectl --context rancher-desktop cluster-info to ensure that an appropriate version of the kubectl client is installed. You could install versioned kubectls manually. This is covered in the next section. "},{"title":"Preparing an Air-Gapped System​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Running When Offline","url":"1.7/how-to-guides/running-air-gapped#preparing-an-air-gapped-system","content":"Here we assume you have some kind of removable media which you can populate on an internet-connected system, and then move over to the air-gapped system. There are two directories that need to be populated in order for Rancher Desktop to function off-line: The Cache Directory​ To populate a source disk (which we refer to here as %SOURCEDISK%, although it is probably some kind of removable medium like a USB thumb drive), you need the following files: k3s-versions.json -- this file is created by Rancher Desktop. It reads a raw JSON file from https://update.k3s.io/v1-release/channels and converts it into a different kind of JSON file. Currently there is no utility to do that conversion; the easiest way to get this file is to run Rancher Desktop on a connected system and save the CACHE/k3s-versions.json file (see below for where CACHE exists on different platforms).Tar archives of Kubernetes K3s images. These are listed at https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases. You'll want to download either the k3s-airgap-images-amd64.tar for AMD/Intel machines, k3s-airgap-images-arm64.tar for M1 machines, or the respective *.tar.zst compressed tarball if you are using k3s v1.26.1 and above. Finally you'll need to download the k3s executable for the selected version. For example, the following commands will let you work with K3s v1.24.3 build 1 offline: cd .../CACHE mkdir v1.24.3+k3s1 cd v1.24.3+k3s1 wget https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.24.3%2Bk3s1/k3s-airgap-images-amd64.tar wget https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.24.3%2Bk3s1/sha256sum-amd64.txt wget https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.24.3%2Bk3s1/k3s  WindowsmacOSLinux On Linux, the cache directory is at $HOME/.cache/rancher-desktop and the commands to populate it would be CACHEDIR=$HOME/.cache/rancher-desktop mkdir -p $CACHEDIR/k3s cp $SOURCEDISK/k3s-versions.json $CACHEDIR/ cp -r $SOURCEDISK/v&lt;MAJOR&gt;.&lt;MINOR&gt;.&lt;PATCH&gt;+k3s&lt;BUILD&gt; $CACHEDIR/k3s/  The kuberlr Directory​ The location of this directory is more straightforward. On all platforms, it's at HOME/.kuberlr/PLATFORM-ARCH where: HOME is the home directory: usually $env:HOMEDRIVE%\\$env:HOMEPATH on Windows, and ~ or $HOME on macOS and Linux.PLATFORM is one of windows, linux, or darwin.ARCH is aarch64 on M1 machines, and amd64 everywhere else. To populate it, determine which versions of Kubernetes you'll be using, and download the appropriate executables from the internet. These would be in: WindowsmacOSLinux https://dl.k8s.io/VERSION/bin/PLATFORM/CPU/kubectl Where: VERSION will have the form vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (like v1.22.1),PLATFORM will be one of darwin, linux, or windows,CPU will arm64 on M1 machines and amd64 everywhere else. For example, to get a kubectl for Windows that will work with Kubernetes v1.22, this Windows command-shell (not PowerShell) command will put it on the SOURCEDISK: wget -O %SOURCEDISK/kubectl1.22.1.exe https://dl.k8s.io/v1.22.1/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe  A Note on Versions​ Kubectl clients are guaranteed to work with servers that are running the same MAJOR version and differ in the MINOR version by at most 1. So for example, if your organization is working with Kubernetes versions v1.21.x, v1.22.x, and v1.23.x, for any patch-version of x, you would only need to install kubectl1.22.x in the .kuberlr directory. But if you copy a v1.24.x of Kubernetes into the CACHE directory, you'll need to ensure there's a compatible kubectl in the .kuberlr directory as well (any of v1.23.x, v1.24.x, or v1.25.x would suffice).

Skaffold handles the workflow for building, pushing, and deploying your application, and it provides building blocks for creating CI/CD pipelines. This enables you to focus on iterating on your application locally while Skaffold continuously deploys to your local or remote Kubernetes cluster. To learn more about Skaffold, refer to the project docs here. In order to demonstrate the steps to set up Skaffold with Rancher Desktop, a sample nodejs app example is provided within the Rancher Desktop docs repository here. Important: Skaffold only works with dockerd (Moby). Therefore, make sure to select your runtime as dockerd from the Kubernetes Settings panel in the Rancher Desktop UI. Visit https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/ to install Skaffold. Clone the Rancher Desktop docs repository and navigate to the express-sample in a terminal as follows: cd docs.rancherdesktop.io/assets/express-sample Run skaffold init. Per the Skaffold docs,skaffold init walks through your project directory and looks for any build configuration files such as Dockerfile, build.gradle/pom.xml, package.json, requirements.txt, or go.mod. We will select Dockerfile and package.json in our example. This will generate the initial configuration file that you can modify as needed. When prompted, select yes to write your config to skaffold.yaml. In your editor, review your app.js and manifests.yaml files. Note that in manifests.yaml, you will have a deployment config as well as a service config. It is only necessary to have 1 replica for testing purposes. Back in your terminal, you'll notice that you will have two options: skaffold run that lets you build and deploy, and skaffold dev that allows you to enter development mode with auto-redeploy. We will use skaffold dev in this example. As you will need to have push access to the image repository, you can either use your docker login, or you can set up a local registry: Docker HubLocal Registry Before running skaffold dev, use your docker login if you have a Docker Hub account. Then, in the files skaffold.yaml and manifests.yaml replace matamagu/express-sample for YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/express-sample as skaffold dev will push the built image to DockerHub. As you go through your development, Skaffold will detect any changes and will automatically go through the build and deployment process again.

Q: Why do I not see my WSL distro under Rancher Desktop's WSL Integration page?​ A: You are likely using a WSL 1 distro. Rancher Desktop supports only WSL 2 distros. You can convert your WSL 1 distro into a WSL 2 distro by running the command wsl --set-version &lt;distro-name&gt; 2. You can also run the command wsl --set-default-version 2 to set all the future distributions you might install to use WSL 2. Q: I do not see an entry for Rancher Desktop when running kubectl config get-contexts, where is it?​ A: Rancher Desktop places its configuration in the default location, ~/.kube/config, and uses that. Your KUBECONFIG environment variable may be set to look elsewhere for configuration files. Q: Rancher Desktop is stuck on Waiting for Kubernetes API, what do I do?​ A: The cause is hard to determine without additional information. Navigate to the Troubleshooting tab and use the button to access the logs. Then go to the Rancher Desktop GitHub page and file an issue with the logs attached. Q: I can no longer run docker compose after installing Rancher Desktop and uninstalling Docker Desktop, what happened?​ A: This was an issue related to earlier versions (prior to 1.1.0) of Rancher Desktop. Rancher Desktop version 1.1.0 and above comes bundled with docker-compose for you, and makes the cli plugins available at ~/.docker/cli-plugins. We strongly recommend you to be on the latest version of Rancher Desktop. If you still don't see docker-compose available then please file a bug on Github. Q: I'm using Homebrew to install Rancher Desktop, but brew install rancher-desktop is failing, why?​ A: Due to the Homebrew cask naming conventions, the -desktop suffix is dropped from the cask formula name. Use brew install rancher instead. Q: How do I fix permission denied errors when trying to use Docker on WSL?​ A: You need write-permission to access the docker socket. There are many ways to go about that, but this is one of the more common approaches. Using the Ubuntu WSL command-line: sudo groupadd docker sudo adduser $USER docker sudo chown root:docker /var/run/docker.sock sudo chmod g+w /var/run/docker.sock newgrp docker Q: How do I fix kubectl: command not found issue on Linux?​ A: By default, Rancher Desktop creates symlinks of kubectl, docker, helm and nerdctl binaries in the /home/&lt;user&gt;/.local/bin directory on Linux. To be able to call these commands directly from the console you may add the directory to your PATH environment variable by executing the following command in console and performing logout and login: echo &quot;export PATH=\\$PATH:/home/$(whoami)/.local/bin&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc Q: How do I fix FATA[0005] subnet 10.4.0.0/24 overlaps with other one on this address space when running a container using nerdctl run?​ A: You will see this error if there's a route rule with an IP address from a conflicting subnet on the Iptables. The conflicting routes could be either from the host network (bridge mode) or the Kubernetes network. A quick workaround to this issue is to shutdown WSL via the command wsl --shutdown. ⚠️ Please note that shutting down WSL will stop all other distros along with the rancher-desktop distro. Q: How do I fix the Installation Aborted error while downgrading from an existing MSI installation to an older EXE version (1.6.x or earlier) on Windows?​ A: You will see this error if the Windows registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventLog\\Application\\RancherDesktopPrivilegedService that is supposed to be deleted during the MSI uninstallation process is not deleted for some reason. Please manually delete the registry key and try installing the EXE version. You can run the below command in a privileged shell to delete the registry key. reg.exe delete HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventLog\\Application\\RancherDesktopPrivilegedService /reg:64 /f Q: Why do I see a blank screen when I launch the Cluster Dashboard?​ A: The Cluster Dashboard may not be running correctly because another process on your machine is using ports 9080 or 9443 that the Dashboard process (steve) depends on. To solve this, identify and terminate the process using those ports. You can use the command below to identify processes using a specific port on your host machine. Note that on macOS and Linux, the Rancher Dashboard process is named steve, while on Windows, it's steve.exe. If steve is the only process using ports 9080 or 9443, do not terminate it.

It should support DNS lookup over VPN connections. It has to be enabled manually by editing an internal configuration file. Q: What does the &quot;WSL Integration&quot; tab do?​ A: This makes the Kubernetes configuration accessible in the displayed WSL distributions so that you can use commands such as kubectl to communicate with Kubernetes. Q: Where can I find detailed logs?​ A: Click on the Troubleshooting tab, then click on Show Logs. Q: How can I enable the dashboard for the Traefik ingress controller?​ A: For security reasons, the Traefik dashboard is not exposed by default. However, it is possible to expose the dashboard in multiple ways. For instance, you can use one of the two approaches shown below. Using port-forward to enable dashboard access​ kubectl port-forward -n kube-system $(kubectl -n kube-system get pods --selector &quot;app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik&quot; --output=name) 9000:9000 Visit http://127.0.0.1:9000/dashboard/ in your browser to view the Traefik dashboard. Using HelmChartConfig to enable dashboard access​ Copy the instructions below into a file, for example, expose-traefik.yaml apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: traefik namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- dashboard: enabled: true ports: traefik: expose: true # Avoid this in production deployments logs: access: enabled: true Run the command kubectl apply -f expose-traefik.yaml Visit http://127.0.0.1:9000/dashboard/ in your browser to view the Traefik dashboard. Q: Can I disable Traefik, and will doing so remove Traefik resources?​ A: Yes, you can disable Traefik in order to free up port 80 and 443 for alternate ingress configuration. Disabling Traefik will not delete existing resources. By default, the Enable Traefik feature is selected under Kubernetes Settings; uncheck this box to disable it. If you want to delete Traefik resources, click on Reset Kubernetes on the Kubernetes Settings panel of the UI. Q: Is there support for internal container port forwarding?​ A: Yes, support for this feature is available on all three platforms, Windows, Linux, and macOS, as of v1.1.0. Q: Does file sharing work similarly to Docker Desktop? Do I have to do any additional configuration to mount volumes to VMs?​ A: Currently, the following directories are shared by default: /Users/$USER on macOS, /home/$USER on Linux, and /tmp/rancher-desktop on both. For Windows, all files are automatically shared via WSL2. Standard Docker volumes that are not generally accessible from the host computer work out of the box. To access other directories on Linux/macOS, you will have to perform additional configuration. If you want to change the behavior of the mounts, that will also require additional configuration. Q: Can containers reach back to host services via host.docker.internal?​ A: Yes. On Windows, you may need to create a firewall rule to allow communication between the host and the container. You can run below command in a privileged powershell to create the firewall rule. New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName &quot;WSL&quot; -Direction Inbound -InterfaceAlias &quot;vEthernet (WSL)&quot; -Action Allow Q: I don't need the Kubernetes cluster deployed by Rancher Desktop; how do I disable it to save resources?​ A: Open Rancher Desktop settings, click the cog to open Preferences, select Kuberentes, uncheck Enable Kubernetes feature is selected under Kubernetes Settings; uncheck this box to disable it. This will allow you to run just containerd or dockerd by without allocating resources for Kubernetes. Q: What's happening to the Kubernetes Image Manager (kim)?​ A: As of version 1.0, Kim is no longer shipped and has been replaced by nerdctl and the Docker CLI. Q: Running brew install rancher is failing with a It seems there is already a Binary at '/usr/local/bin/&lt;BINARY&gt;' error, why?​ A: If any of the Rancher Desktop supporting utilities (Helm, kubectl, nerdctl, docker) are already managed by Homebrew, then the installation fails due to how the Homebrew cask formula is defined. Installing using the Mac app will avoid this issue. Q: I installed nerdctl through the Arch User Repository, but it doesn't work with Rancher Desktop, why?​ A: For Rancher Desktop, nerdctl must run inside the VM and not on the host. The host version distributed with Rancher Desktop is just a shell wrapper to execute the command inside the VM. Q: The tools on the Support Utilities page (in Rancher Desktop &lt;1.3.0) are not installed and I see an Insufficient permission to manipulate /usr/local/bin error, how do I fix it?​ A: This occurs when you do not have ownership of /usr/local/bin. A long-term solution to improve the handling of permissions is in the works. In the meantime, a temporary workaround is to change ownership of /usr/local/bin by running sudo chown $USER /usr/local/bin. When you are able to write to the directory, Rancher Desktop should be able to create the symlinks. From versions 1.3.0 and above, we no longer create symlinks in /usr/local/bin but in ~/.rd/bin and put that directory on the PATH instead, to avoid having to deal with write permissions to /usr/local/bin and file conflicts. We strongly recommend you to upgrade to the latest version of Rancher Desktop. Q: Is Cygwin compatible with Rancher Desktop?​ A: No, but there are plans to add compatibility. Q: How can I add Rancher Desktop to the startup programs list on Windows?​ A: On Windows, you can add a program to startup programs list in a number of ways. For example, you can use the following steps. Press Windows+R to open the Run dialog box.Type shell:startup and then hit Enter to open the Startup folder.Copy &quot;Rancher Desktop&quot; shortcut from Desktop and paste in Startup folder.Restart your machine. Q: Where does Rancher Desktop actually put the data volumes?​ A: Windows:Open Run menu (Press Windows + R) and open the path provided below, depending on the active container runtime. dockerd(moby): \\\\wsl$\\rancher-desktop-data\\var\\lib\\docker\\volumes containerd: \\\\wsl$\\rancher-desktop-data\\var\\lib\\nerdctl\\dbb19c5e\\volumes\\&lt;namespace&gt; macOS &amp; Linux:Navigate to the path provided below in the (lima) VM, depending on the active container runtime. You can use rdctl shell to access these paths in the VM. dockerd(moby): /var/lib/docker/volumes containerd: /var/lib/nerdctl/dbb19c5e/volumes/&lt;namespace&gt; Q: How can I downgrade Rancher Desktop to a non-current (older) release version​ A: We strongly recommend you use the current release version as it has the latest features and bug fixes included. However, if you want to downgrade to an earlier version, please follow the steps below. Perform Troubleshooting &gt; Factory Reset from the current installation. Please make sure the Keep cached Kubernetes images box is not checked in the Factory Reset pop up dialog.Uninstall the current version by following uninstallation instructions for your OS.Install the older version that you need.","keywords":""},{"title":"Installation","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"1.8/getting-started/installation","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"macOS​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Installation","url":"1.8/getting-started/installation#macos","content":""},{"title":"Requirements​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Installation","url":"1.8/getting-started/installation#requirements","content":"Rancher Desktop requires the following on macOS: macOS Catalina 10.15 or higher.Apple Silicon (M1) or Intel CPU with VT-x.Persistent internet connection.

See below for details. It is also recommended to have: 8 GB of memory4 CPU Additional resources may be required depending on the workloads you plan to run. Ensuring You Have Access to /dev/kvm​ On some distributions (Ubuntu 18.04 for example) the user has insufficient privileges to use /dev/kvm, which is required for Rancher Desktop. To check whether you have the required privileges, do: [ -r /dev/kvm ] &amp;&amp; [ -w /dev/kvm ] || echo 'insufficient privileges'  If it outputs insufficient privileges, you need to add your user to thekvm group. You can do this with: sudo usermod -a -G kvm &quot;$USER&quot;  Then reboot in order to make these changes take effect. pass Setup​ By default, Rancher Desktop uses pass to securely store credentials passed via docker login and nerdctl login. pass requires a small amount of setup if this is the first time it has been used on your machine. If you don't intend to use docker login or nerdctl login you don't have to set uppass - just remember that if you use them in the future, you must set it up or you will run into errors. Once Rancher Desktop is installed, you should create a GPG key. This will be used by pass to secure secrets. You can create a GPG key with: gpg --generate-key  The output should contain something like 8D818FB37A9279E341F01506ED96AD27A40C9C73. This is your key ID. You can then initialize pass by passing this key ID to it: pass init 8D818FB37A9279E341F01506ED96AD27A40C9C73  For more information on pass, please see its website. Traefik Port Binding Access​ Rancher Desktop makes use of Traefik as the default ingress controller. Users may run into a permission denied error after deploying Rancher Desktop due to restricted port access on the Traefik ingress. Most Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu 20.04) do not allow non-root users to listen on TCP and UDP ports below 1024. In order to allow Traefik to listen to privileged ports on the local host, please run the following command: sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80  After the command is run, all ports 80 and above will become unprivileged and Traefik will be able to successfully access said ports. To preserve this change across reboots as a custom kernel parameter setting, add the same command inside your /etc/sysctl.conf file.

"},{"title":"Existing Deployments​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Running When Offline","url":"1.8/how-to-guides/running-air-gapped#existing-deployments","content":"If Rancher Desktop has been installed on a machine initially with networked access, it can be run subsequently on that machine after network connectivity has been turned off. The main difference in core functionality is that the list of versions of Kubernetes available in drop-down menus is limited to those versions that have actually been downloaded and stored in the cache. There is a problem using the kubectl client, because of the kuberlr wrapper (Windows users should add the .exe suffix to each executable utility file). In this case, we're discussing a system that was initialized when connected to the internet, but we're about to take the machine offline for future use. Suppose there are three versions of k3s in the rancher-desktop cache. 1.24.3 1.21.14 1.19.16 But suppose that on this system we only ran kubectl when using versions 1.24.3 and 1.21.14. This means that the ~/.kuberlr/PLATFORM-ARCH/ directory ($env:HOMEDRIVE%\\$env:HOMEPATH/.kuberlr/windows-amd64 on Windows) will contain only two files: kubectl1.24.3 kubectl1.21.14 If we go offline and use the UI to switch to Kubernetes 1.19.16, when kubectl is run, the system will fail. The problem is that kubectl is an alias for kuberlr, which will try to download kubectl 1.19.16 and install it in the .kuberlr directory, but won't be able to access it. So in this case, it would be best to prepare a connected system for disconnecting by selecting each available version of Kubernetes currently in the cache, and running kubectl --context rancher-desktop cluster-info to ensure that an appropriate version of the kubectl client is installed. You could install versioned kubectls manually. This is covered in the next section. "},{"title":"Preparing an Air-Gapped System​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Running When Offline","url":"1.8/how-to-guides/running-air-gapped#preparing-an-air-gapped-system","content":"Here we assume you have some kind of removable media which you can populate on an internet-connected system, and then move over to the air-gapped system. There are two directories that need to be populated in order for Rancher Desktop to function off-line: The Cache Directory​ To populate a source disk (which we refer to here as %SOURCEDISK%, although it is probably some kind of removable medium like a USB thumb drive), you need the following files: k3s-versions.json -- this file is created by Rancher Desktop. It reads a raw JSON file from https://update.k3s.io/v1-release/channels and converts it into a different kind of JSON file. Currently there is no utility to do that conversion; the easiest way to get this file is to run Rancher Desktop on a connected system and save the CACHE/k3s-versions.json file (see below for where CACHE exists on different platforms).Tar archives of Kubernetes K3s images. These are listed at https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases. You'll want to download either the k3s-airgap-images-amd64.tar for AMD/Intel machines, k3s-airgap-images-arm64.tar for M1 machines, or the respective *.tar.zst compressed tarball if you are using k3s v1.26.1 and above. Finally you'll need to download the k3s executable for the selected version. For example, the following commands will let you work with K3s v1.24.3 build 1 offline: cd .../CACHE mkdir v1.24.3+k3s1 cd v1.24.3+k3s1 wget https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.24.3%2Bk3s1/k3s-airgap-images-amd64.tar wget https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.24.3%2Bk3s1/sha256sum-amd64.txt wget https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.24.3%2Bk3s1/k3s  WindowsmacOSLinux On Linux, the cache directory is at $HOME/.cache/rancher-desktop and the commands to populate it would be CACHEDIR=$HOME/.cache/rancher-desktop mkdir -p $CACHEDIR/k3s cp $SOURCEDISK/k3s-versions.json $CACHEDIR/ cp -r $SOURCEDISK/v&lt;MAJOR&gt;.&lt;MINOR&gt;.&lt;PATCH&gt;+k3s&lt;BUILD&gt; $CACHEDIR/k3s/  The kuberlr Directory​ The location of this directory is more straightforward. On all platforms, it's at HOME/.kuberlr/PLATFORM-ARCH where: HOME is the home directory: usually $env:HOMEDRIVE%\\$env:HOMEPATH on Windows, and ~ or $HOME on macOS and Linux.PLATFORM is one of windows, linux, or darwin.ARCH is aarch64 on M1 machines, and amd64 everywhere else. To populate it, determine which versions of Kubernetes you'll be using, and download the appropriate executables from the internet. These would be in: WindowsmacOSLinux https://dl.k8s.io/VERSION/bin/PLATFORM/CPU/kubectl Where: VERSION will have the form vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (like v1.22.1),PLATFORM will be one of darwin, linux, or windows,CPU will arm64 on M1 machines and amd64 everywhere else. For example, to get a kubectl for Windows that will work with Kubernetes v1.22, this Windows command-shell (not PowerShell) command will put it on the SOURCEDISK: wget -O %SOURCEDISK/kubectl1.22.1.exe https://dl.k8s.io/v1.22.1/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe  A Note on Versions​ Kubectl clients are guaranteed to work with servers that are running the same MAJOR version and differ in the MINOR version by at most 1. So for example, if your organization is working with Kubernetes versions v1.21.x, v1.22.x, and v1.23.x, for any patch-version of x, you would only need to install kubectl1.22.x in the .kuberlr directory. But if you copy a v1.24.x of Kubernetes into the CACHE directory, you'll need to ensure there's a compatible kubectl in the .kuberlr directory as well (any of v1.23.x, v1.24.x, or v1.25.x would suffice).

Skaffold handles the workflow for building, pushing, and deploying your application, and it provides building blocks for creating CI/CD pipelines. This enables you to focus on iterating on your application locally while Skaffold continuously deploys to your local or remote Kubernetes cluster. To learn more about Skaffold, refer to the project docs here. In order to demonstrate the steps to set up Skaffold with Rancher Desktop, a sample nodejs app example is provided within the Rancher Desktop docs repository here. Important: Skaffold only works with dockerd (Moby). Therefore, make sure to select your runtime as dockerd from the Kubernetes Settings panel in the Rancher Desktop UI. Visit https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/ to install Skaffold. Clone the Rancher Desktop docs repository and navigate to the express-sample in a terminal as follows: cd docs.rancherdesktop.io/assets/express-sample Run skaffold init. Per the Skaffold docs,skaffold init walks through your project directory and looks for any build configuration files such as Dockerfile, build.gradle/pom.xml, package.json, requirements.txt, or go.mod. We will select Dockerfile and package.json in our example. This will generate the initial configuration file that you can modify as needed. When prompted, select yes to write your config to skaffold.yaml. In your editor, review your app.js and manifests.yaml files. Note that in manifests.yaml, you will have a deployment config as well as a service config. It is only necessary to have 1 replica for testing purposes. Back in your terminal, you'll notice that you will have two options: skaffold run that lets you build and deploy, and skaffold dev that allows you to enter development mode with auto-redeploy. We will use skaffold dev in this example. As you will need to have push access to the image repository, you can either use your docker login, or you can set up a local registry: Docker HubLocal Registry Before running skaffold dev, use your docker login if you have a Docker Hub account. Then, in the files skaffold.yaml and manifests.yaml replace matamagu/express-sample for YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/express-sample as skaffold dev will push the built image to DockerHub. As you go through your development, Skaffold will detect any changes and will automatically go through the build and deployment process again. You will be able to see any changes reflected in the cluster.

Q: How can I fix the Docker error when starting a container using the VS Code dev-containers extension with version &gt;v0.266?​ A: There is a current workaround for users experiencing a Docker error when starting a container using the dev-containers extension for VS code versioned v0.266 or later and Rancher Desktop v1.8.1. Disabling Wayland in the user settings will allow the container to spin up successfully. This can be accomplished by unchecking the box in the Settings &gt; Extensions &gt; Dev Containers tab labelled Dev &gt; Containers: Mount Wayland Socket (Applies to All Profiles). Q: Why do I not see my WSL distro under Rancher Desktop's WSL Integration page?​ A: You are likely using a WSL 1 distro. Rancher Desktop supports only WSL 2 distros. You can convert your WSL 1 distro into a WSL 2 distro by running the command wsl --set-version &lt;distro-name&gt; 2. You can also run the command wsl --set-default-version 2 to set all the future distributions you might install to use WSL 2. Q: I do not see an entry for Rancher Desktop when running kubectl config get-contexts, where is it?​ A: Rancher Desktop places its configuration in the default location, ~/.kube/config, and uses that. Your KUBECONFIG environment variable may be set to look elsewhere for configuration files. Q: Rancher Desktop is stuck on Waiting for Kubernetes API, what do I do?​ A: The cause is hard to determine without additional information. Navigate to the Troubleshooting tab and use the button to access the logs. Then go to the Rancher Desktop GitHub page and file an issue with the logs attached. Q: I can no longer run docker compose after installing Rancher Desktop and uninstalling Docker Desktop, what happened?​ A: This was an issue related to earlier versions (prior to 1.1.0) of Rancher Desktop. Rancher Desktop version 1.1.0 and above comes bundled with docker-compose for you, and makes the cli plugins available at ~/.docker/cli-plugins. We strongly recommend you to be on the latest version of Rancher Desktop. If you still don't see docker-compose available then please file a bug on Github. Q: I'm using Homebrew to install Rancher Desktop, but brew install rancher-desktop is failing, why?​ A: Due to the Homebrew cask naming conventions, the -desktop suffix is dropped from the cask formula name. Use brew install rancher instead. Q: How do I fix permission denied errors when trying to use Docker on WSL?​ A: You need write-permission to access the docker socket. There are many ways to go about that, but this is one of the more common approaches. Using the Ubuntu WSL command-line: sudo groupadd docker sudo adduser $USER docker sudo chown root:docker /var/run/docker.sock sudo chmod g+w /var/run/docker.sock newgrp docker Q: How do I fix kubectl: command not found issue on Linux?​ A: By default, Rancher Desktop creates symlinks of kubectl, docker, helm and nerdctl binaries in the /home/&lt;user&gt;/.local/bin directory on Linux. To be able to call these commands directly from the console you may add the directory to your PATH environment variable by executing the following command in console and performing logout and login: echo &quot;export PATH=\\$PATH:/home/$(whoami)/.local/bin&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc Q: How do I fix FATA[0005] subnet 10.4.0.0/24 overlaps with other one on this address space when running a container using nerdctl run?​ A: You will see this error if there's a route rule with an IP address from a conflicting subnet on the Iptables. The conflicting routes could be either from the host network (bridge mode) or the Kubernetes network. A quick workaround to this issue is to shutdown WSL via the command wsl --shutdown. ⚠️ Please note that shutting down WSL will stop all other distros along with the rancher-desktop distro. Q: How do I fix the Installation Aborted error while downgrading from an existing MSI installation to an older EXE version (1.6.x or earlier) on Windows?​ A: You will see this error if the Windows registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventLog\\Application\\RancherDesktopPrivilegedService that is supposed to be deleted during the MSI uninstallation process is not deleted for some reason. Please manually delete the registry key and try installing the EXE version. You can run the below command in a privileged shell to delete the registry key. reg.exe delete HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventLog\\Application\\RancherDesktopPrivilegedService /reg:64 /f Q: Why do I see a blank screen when I launch the Cluster Dashboard?​ A: The Cluster Dashboard may not be running correctly because another process on your machine is using ports 9080 or 9443 that the Dashboard process (steve) depends on. To solve this, identify and terminate the process using those ports. You can use the command below to identify processes using a specific port on your host machine. Note that on macOS and Linux, the Rancher Dashboard process is named steve, while on Windows, it's steve.exe. If steve is the only process using ports 9080 or 9443, do not terminate it.

Q: Is Rancher Desktop a desktop version of Rancher?​ A: No. Rancher Desktop is not Rancher on the Desktop. While Rancher and Rancher Desktop share the Rancher name, they do different things. But, the two solutions do complement each other: Rancher is a complete software stack for managing multiple Kubernetes clusters across any infrastructure. Rancher Desktop provides container management and a Kubernetes instance on the desktop to support local development use cases. Q: Is there a Kubernetes Cluster Explorer available in Rancher Desktop?​ A: Yes, the Rancher Dashboard is included as a feature preview in the release 1.2.1. Invoke the dashboard by clicking on Dashboard option in the system tray menu. Learn more about Rancher Desktop. Learn more about Rancher. Q: Can I have Docker Desktop installed alongside Rancher Desktop?​ A: Yes, but they cannot be run at the same time as both Rancher Desktop and Docker Desktop use the same Docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock). Be sure to stop one before starting the other. Q: How can I perform a clean uninstall of Rancher Desktop?​ A: First, perform a Factory Reset, and then uninstall the app. The uninstall process varies based on the operating system. For more information, please refer here. Q: What support, if any, is available for DNS over VPN on Windows?​ A: An alternative DNS resolver for Windows has been implemented to address some of the VPN issues on Windows. It should support DNS lookup over VPN connections. It has to be enabled manually by editing an internal configuration file. Q: What does the &quot;WSL Integration&quot; tab do?​ A: This makes the Kubernetes configuration accessible in the displayed WSL distributions so that you can use commands such as kubectl to communicate with Kubernetes. Q: Where can I find detailed logs?​ A: Click on the Troubleshooting tab, then click on Show Logs. Q: How can I enable the dashboard for the Traefik ingress controller?​ A: For security reasons, the Traefik dashboard is not exposed by default. However, it is possible to expose the dashboard in multiple ways. For instance, you can use one of the two approaches shown below. Using port-forward to enable dashboard access​ kubectl port-forward -n kube-system $(kubectl -n kube-system get pods --selector &quot;app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik&quot; --output=name) 9000:9000 Visit http://127.0.0.1:9000/dashboard/ in your browser to view the Traefik dashboard. Using HelmChartConfig to enable dashboard access​ Copy the instructions below into a file, for example, expose-traefik.yaml apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: traefik namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- dashboard: enabled: true ports: traefik: expose: true # Avoid this in production deployments logs: access: enabled: true Run the command kubectl apply -f expose-traefik.yaml Visit http://127.0.0.1:9000/dashboard/ in your browser to view the Traefik dashboard. Q: Can I disable Traefik, and will doing so remove Traefik resources?​ A: Yes, you can disable Traefik in order to free up port 80 and 443 for alternate ingress configuration. Disabling Traefik will not delete existing resources. By default, the Enable Traefik feature is selected under Kubernetes Settings; uncheck this box to disable it. If you want to delete Traefik resources, click on Reset Kubernetes on the Kubernetes Settings panel of the UI. Q: Is there support for internal container port forwarding?​ A: Yes, support for this feature is available on all three platforms, Windows, Linux, and macOS, as of v1.1.0. Q: Does file sharing work similarly to Docker Desktop? Do I have to do any additional configuration to mount volumes to VMs?​ A: Currently, the following directories are shared by default: /Users/$USER on macOS, /home/$USER on Linux, and /tmp/rancher-desktop on both. For Windows, all files are automatically shared via WSL2. Standard Docker volumes that are not generally accessible from the host computer work out of the box. To access other directories on Linux/macOS, you will have to perform additional configuration. If you want to change the behavior of the mounts, that will also require additional configuration. Q: Can containers reach back to host services via host.docker.internal?​ A: Yes. On Windows, you may need to create a firewall rule to allow communication between the host and the container. You can run below command in a privileged powershell to create the firewall rule. New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName &quot;WSL&quot; -Direction Inbound -InterfaceAlias &quot;vEthernet (WSL)&quot; -Action Allow Q: I don't need the Kubernetes cluster deployed by Rancher Desktop; how do I disable it to save resources?​ A: Open Rancher Desktop settings, click the cog to open Preferences, select Kuberentes, uncheck Enable Kubernetes feature is selected under Kubernetes Settings; uncheck this box to disable it. This will allow you to run just containerd or dockerd by without allocating resources for Kubernetes. Q: What's happening to the Kubernetes Image Manager (kim)?​ A: As of version 1.0, Kim is no longer shipped and has been replaced by nerdctl and the Docker CLI. Q: Running brew install rancher is failing with a It seems there is already a Binary at '/usr/local/bin/&lt;BINARY&gt;' error, why?​ A: If any of the Rancher Desktop supporting utilities (Helm, kubectl, nerdctl, docker) are already managed by Homebrew, then the installation fails due to how the Homebrew cask formula is defined. Installing using the Mac app will avoid this issue. Q: I installed nerdctl through the Arch User Repository, but it doesn't work with Rancher Desktop, why?​ A: For Rancher Desktop, nerdctl must run inside the VM and not on the host. The host version distributed with Rancher Desktop is just a shell wrapper to execute the command inside the VM. Q: The tools on the Support Utilities page (in Rancher Desktop &lt;1.3.0) are not installed and I see an Insufficient permission to manipulate /usr/local/bin error, how do I fix it?​ A: This occurs when you do not have ownership of /usr/local/bin. A long-term solution to improve the handling of permissions is in the works. In the meantime, a temporary workaround is to change ownership of /usr/local/bin by running sudo chown $USER /usr/local/bin. When you are able to write to the directory, Rancher Desktop should be able to create the symlinks. From versions 1.3.0 and above, we no longer create symlinks in /usr/local/bin but in ~/.rd/bin and put that directory on the PATH instead, to avoid having to deal with write permissions to /usr/local/bin and file conflicts. We strongly recommend you to upgrade to the latest version of Rancher Desktop. Q: Is Cygwin compatible with Rancher Desktop?​ A: No, but there are plans to add compatibility. Q: How can I add Rancher Desktop to the startup programs list on Windows?​ A: On Windows, you can add a program to startup programs list in a number of ways. For example, you can use the following steps. Press Windows+R to open the Run dialog box.Type shell:startup and then hit Enter to open the Startup folder.Copy &quot;Rancher Desktop&quot; shortcut from Desktop and paste in Startup folder.Restart your machine. Q: Where does Rancher Desktop actually put the data volumes?​ A: Windows:Open Run menu (Press Windows + R) and open the path provided below, depending on the active container runtime. dockerd(moby): \\\\wsl$\\rancher-desktop-data\\var\\lib\\docker\\volumes containerd: \\\\wsl$\\rancher-desktop-data\\var\\lib\\nerdctl\\dbb19c5e\\volumes\\&lt;namespace&gt; macOS &amp; Linux:Navigate to the path provided below in the (lima) VM, depending on the active container runtime. You can use rdctl shell to access these paths in the VM. dockerd(moby): /var/lib/docker/volumes containerd: /var/lib/nerdctl/dbb19c5e/volumes/&lt;namespace&gt; Q: How can I downgrade Rancher Desktop to a non-current (older) release version​ A: We strongly recommend you use the current release version as it has the latest features and bug fixes included. However, if you want to downgrade to an earlier version, please follow the steps below. Perform Troubleshooting &gt; Factory Reset from the current installation.

See below for details. It is also recommended to have: 8 GB of memory4 CPU Additional resources may be required depending on the workloads you plan to run. Ensuring You Have Access to /dev/kvm​ On some distributions (Ubuntu 18.04 for example) the user has insufficient privileges to use /dev/kvm, which is required for Rancher Desktop. To check whether you have the required privileges, do: [ -r /dev/kvm ] &amp;&amp; [ -w /dev/kvm ] || echo 'insufficient privileges'  If it outputs insufficient privileges, you need to add your user to thekvm group. You can do this with: sudo usermod -a -G kvm &quot;$USER&quot;  Then reboot in order to make these changes take effect. pass Setup​ By default, Rancher Desktop uses pass to securely store credentials passed via docker login and nerdctl login. pass requires a small amount of setup if this is the first time it has been used on your machine. If you don't intend to use docker login or nerdctl login you don't have to set uppass - just remember that if you use them in the future, you must set it up or you will run into errors. Once Rancher Desktop is installed, you should create a GPG key. This will be used by pass to secure secrets. You can create a GPG key with: gpg --generate-key  The output should contain something like 8D818FB37A9279E341F01506ED96AD27A40C9C73. This is your key ID. You can then initialize pass by passing this key ID to it: pass init 8D818FB37A9279E341F01506ED96AD27A40C9C73  For more information on pass, please see its website. Traefik Port Binding Access​ Rancher Desktop makes use of Traefik as the default ingress controller. Users may run into a permission denied error after deploying Rancher Desktop due to restricted port access on the Traefik ingress. Most Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu 20.04) do not allow non-root users to listen on TCP and UDP ports below 1024. In order to allow Traefik to listen to privileged ports on the local host, please run the following command: sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80  After the command is run, all ports 80 and above will become unprivileged and Traefik will be able to successfully access said ports. To preserve this change across reboots as a custom kernel parameter setting, add the same command inside your /etc/sysctl.conf file.

"},{"title":"Existing Deployments​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Running When Offline","url":"1.9/how-to-guides/running-air-gapped#existing-deployments","content":"If Rancher Desktop has been installed on a machine initially with networked access, it can be run subsequently on that machine after network connectivity has been turned off. The main difference in core functionality is that the list of versions of Kubernetes available in drop-down menus is limited to those versions that have actually been downloaded and stored in the cache. There is a problem using the kubectl client, because of the kuberlr wrapper (Windows users should add the .exe suffix to each executable utility file). In this case, we're discussing a system that was initialized when connected to the internet, but we're about to take the machine offline for future use. Suppose there are three versions of k3s in the rancher-desktop cache. 1.24.3 1.21.14 1.19.16 But suppose that on this system we only ran kubectl when using versions 1.24.3 and 1.21.14. This means that the ~/.kuberlr/PLATFORM-ARCH/ directory ($env:HOMEDRIVE%\\$env:HOMEPATH/.kuberlr/windows-amd64 on Windows) will contain only two files: kubectl1.24.3 kubectl1.21.14 If we go offline and use the UI to switch to Kubernetes 1.19.16, when kubectl is run, the system will fail. The problem is that kubectl is an alias for kuberlr, which will try to download kubectl 1.19.16 and install it in the .kuberlr directory, but won't be able to access it. So in this case, it would be best to prepare a connected system for disconnecting by selecting each available version of Kubernetes currently in the cache, and running kubectl --context rancher-desktop cluster-info to ensure that an appropriate version of the kubectl client is installed.

There are two directories that need to be populated in order for Rancher Desktop to function off-line: The Cache Directory​ To populate a source disk (which we refer to here as %SOURCEDISK%, although it is probably some kind of removable medium like a USB thumb drive), you need the following files: k3s-versions.json -- this file is created by Rancher Desktop. It reads a raw JSON file from https://update.k3s.io/v1-release/channels and converts it into a different kind of JSON file. Currently there is no utility to do that conversion; the easiest way to get this file is to run Rancher Desktop on a connected system and save the CACHE/k3s-versions.json file (see below for where CACHE exists on different platforms).Tar archives of Kubernetes K3s images. These are listed at https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases. You'll want to download either the k3s-airgap-images-amd64.tar for AMD/Intel machines, k3s-airgap-images-arm64.tar for M1 machines, or the respective *.tar.zst compressed tarball if you are using k3s v1.26.1 and above. Finally you'll need to download the k3s executable for the selected version. For example, the following commands will let you work with K3s v1.24.3 build 1 offline: cd .../CACHE mkdir v1.24.3+k3s1 cd v1.24.3+k3s1 wget https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.24.3%2Bk3s1/k3s-airgap-images-amd64.tar wget https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.24.3%2Bk3s1/sha256sum-amd64.txt wget https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.24.3%2Bk3s1/k3s  WindowsmacOSLinux On Linux, the cache directory is at $HOME/.cache/rancher-desktop and the commands to populate it would be CACHEDIR=$HOME/.cache/rancher-desktop mkdir -p $CACHEDIR/k3s cp $SOURCEDISK/k3s-versions.json $CACHEDIR/ cp -r $SOURCEDISK/v&lt;MAJOR&gt;.&lt;MINOR&gt;.&lt;PATCH&gt;+k3s&lt;BUILD&gt; $CACHEDIR/k3s/  The kuberlr Directory​ The location of this directory is more straightforward. On all platforms, it's at HOME/.kuberlr/PLATFORM-ARCH where: HOME is the home directory: usually $env:HOMEDRIVE%\\$env:HOMEPATH on Windows, and ~ or $HOME on macOS and Linux.PLATFORM is one of windows, linux, or darwin.ARCH is aarch64 on M1 machines, and amd64 everywhere else. To populate it, determine which versions of Kubernetes you'll be using, and download the appropriate executables from the internet. These would be in: WindowsmacOSLinux https://dl.k8s.io/VERSION/bin/PLATFORM/CPU/kubectl Where: VERSION will have the form vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (like v1.22.1),PLATFORM will be one of darwin, linux, or windows,CPU will arm64 on M1 machines and amd64 everywhere else. For example, to get a kubectl for Windows that will work with Kubernetes v1.22, this Windows command-shell (not PowerShell) command will put it on the SOURCEDISK: wget -O %SOURCEDISK/kubectl1.22.1.exe https://dl.k8s.io/v1.22.1/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe  A Note on Versions​ Kubectl clients are guaranteed to work with servers that are running the same MAJOR version and differ in the MINOR version by at most 1. So for example, if your organization is working with Kubernetes versions v1.21.x, v1.22.x, and v1.23.x, for any patch-version of x, you would only need to install kubectl1.22.x in the .kuberlr directory. But if you copy a v1.24.x of Kubernetes into the CACHE directory, you'll need to ensure there's a compatible kubectl in the .kuberlr directory as well (any of v1.23.x, v1.24.x, or v1.25.x would suffice).

Skaffold handles the workflow for building, pushing, and deploying your application, and it provides building blocks for creating CI/CD pipelines. This enables you to focus on iterating on your application locally while Skaffold continuously deploys to your local or remote Kubernetes cluster. To learn more about Skaffold, refer to the project docs here. In order to demonstrate the steps to set up Skaffold with Rancher Desktop, a sample nodejs app example is provided within the Rancher Desktop docs repository here. Important: Skaffold only works with dockerd (Moby). Therefore, make sure to select your runtime as dockerd from the Kubernetes Settings panel in the Rancher Desktop UI. Visit https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/ to install Skaffold. Clone the Rancher Desktop docs repository and navigate to the express-sample in a terminal as follows: cd docs.rancherdesktop.io/assets/express-sample Run skaffold init. Per the Skaffold docs,skaffold init walks through your project directory and looks for any build configuration files such as Dockerfile, build.gradle/pom.xml, package.json, requirements.txt, or go.mod. We will select Dockerfile and package.json in our example. This will generate the initial configuration file that you can modify as needed. When prompted, select yes to write your config to skaffold.yaml. In your editor, review your app.js and manifests.yaml files. Note that in manifests.yaml, you will have a deployment config as well as a service config. It is only necessary to have 1 replica for testing purposes. Back in your terminal, you'll notice that you will have two options: skaffold run that lets you build and deploy, and skaffold dev that allows you to enter development mode with auto-redeploy. We will use skaffold dev in this example. As you will need to have push access to the image repository, you can either use your docker login, or you can set up a local registry: Docker HubLocal Registry Before running skaffold dev, use your docker login if you have a Docker Hub account. Then, in the files skaffold.yaml and manifests.yaml replace matamagu/express-sample for YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/express-sample as skaffold dev will push the built image to DockerHub. As you go through your development, Skaffold will detect any changes and will automatically go through the build and deployment process again. You will be able to see any changes reflected in the cluster.

From here, you can debug the application as if it's running on your host.   Sometimes, the application might not break at the set breakpoint on the first run as the debugging process may not have started. In this case, refresh the browser to trigger the execution again to hit the breakpoint. You can also get around this behavior by setting the property inspectMode: 'break' in task.json file to prevent the app from running until the debugger attaches. On some machines, the firewall settings might prevent the debugging process from establishing a connection between the host and the container processes. In this case, you can add a firewall rule to allow communication between the VM where the container is running and the host where you have the VS Code session running.

Q: How can I fix the Docker error when starting a container using the VS Code dev-containers extension with version &gt;v0.266?​ A: There is a current workaround for users experiencing a Docker error when starting a container using the dev-containers extension for VS code versioned v0.266 or later and Rancher Desktop v1.8.1. Disabling Wayland in the user settings will allow the container to spin up successfully. This can be accomplished by unchecking the box in the Settings &gt; Extensions &gt; Dev Containers tab labelled Dev &gt; Containers: Mount Wayland Socket (Applies to All Profiles). Q: Why do I not see my WSL distro under Rancher Desktop's WSL Integration page?​ A: You are likely using a WSL 1 distro. Rancher Desktop supports only WSL 2 distros. You can convert your WSL 1 distro into a WSL 2 distro by running the command wsl --set-version &lt;distro-name&gt; 2. You can also run the command wsl --set-default-version 2 to set all the future distributions you might install to use WSL 2. Q: I do not see an entry for Rancher Desktop when running kubectl config get-contexts, where is it?​ A: Rancher Desktop places its configuration in the default location, ~/.kube/config, and uses that. Your KUBECONFIG environment variable may be set to look elsewhere for configuration files. Q: Rancher Desktop is stuck on Waiting for Kubernetes API, what do I do?​ A: The cause is hard to determine without additional information. Navigate to the Troubleshooting tab and use the button to access the logs. Then go to the Rancher Desktop GitHub page and file an issue with the logs attached. Q: I can no longer run docker compose after installing Rancher Desktop and uninstalling Docker Desktop, what happened?​ A: This was an issue related to earlier versions (prior to 1.1.0) of Rancher Desktop. Rancher Desktop version 1.1.0 and above comes bundled with docker-compose for you, and makes the cli plugins available at ~/.docker/cli-plugins. We strongly recommend you to be on the latest version of Rancher Desktop. If you still don't see docker-compose available then please file a bug on Github. Q: I'm using Homebrew to install Rancher Desktop, but brew install rancher-desktop is failing, why?​ A: Due to the Homebrew cask naming conventions, the -desktop suffix is dropped from the cask formula name. Use brew install rancher instead. Q: How do I fix permission denied errors when trying to use Docker on WSL?​ A: You need write-permission to access the docker socket. There are many ways to go about that, but this is one of the more common approaches. Using the Ubuntu WSL command-line: sudo groupadd docker sudo adduser $USER docker sudo chown root:docker /var/run/docker.sock sudo chmod g+w /var/run/docker.sock newgrp docker Q: How do I fix kubectl: command not found issue on Linux?​ A: By default, Rancher Desktop creates symlinks of kubectl, docker, helm and nerdctl binaries in the /home/&lt;user&gt;/.local/bin directory on Linux. To be able to call these commands directly from the console you may add the directory to your PATH environment variable by executing the following command in console and performing logout and login: echo &quot;export PATH=\\$PATH:/home/$(whoami)/.local/bin&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc Q: How do I fix FATA[0005] subnet 10.4.0.0/24 overlaps with other one on this address space when running a container using nerdctl run?​ A: You will see this error if there's a route rule with an IP address from a conflicting subnet on the Iptables. The conflicting routes could be either from the host network (bridge mode) or the Kubernetes network. A quick workaround to this issue is to shutdown WSL via the command wsl --shutdown. ⚠️ Please note that shutting down WSL will stop all other distros along with the rancher-desktop distro. Q: How do I fix the Installation Aborted error while downgrading from an existing MSI installation to an older EXE version (1.6.x or earlier) on Windows?​ A: You will see this error if the Windows registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventLog\\Application\\RancherDesktopPrivilegedService that is supposed to be deleted during the MSI uninstallation process is not deleted for some reason. Please manually delete the registry key and try installing the EXE version. You can run the below command in a privileged shell to delete the registry key. reg.exe delete HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventLog\\Application\\RancherDesktopPrivilegedService /reg:64 /f Q: Why do I see a blank screen when I launch the Cluster Dashboard?​ A: The Cluster Dashboard may not be running correctly because another process on your machine is using ports 9080 or 9443 that the Dashboard process (steve) depends on. To solve this, identify and terminate the process using those ports. You can use the command below to identify processes using a specific port on your host machine. Note that on macOS and Linux, the Rancher Dashboard process is named steve, while on Windows, it's steve.exe. If steve is the only process using ports 9080 or 9443, do not terminate it.

By default, nerdctl images are stored in the default namespace. If you want your images available for use by Kubernetes, use the --namespace k8s.io or -n k8s.io CLI argument. You can also switch to a namespace called default or any other name using the option --namespace &lt;NAMESPACE_NAME&gt;.

Q: Is Rancher Desktop a desktop version of Rancher?​ A: No. Rancher Desktop is not Rancher on the Desktop. While Rancher and Rancher Desktop share the Rancher name, they do different things. But, the two solutions do complement each other: Rancher is a complete software stack for managing multiple Kubernetes clusters across any infrastructure. Rancher Desktop provides container management and a Kubernetes instance on the desktop to support local development use cases. Q: Is there a Kubernetes Cluster Explorer available in Rancher Desktop?​ A: Yes, the Rancher Dashboard is included as a feature preview in the release 1.2.1. Invoke the dashboard by clicking on Dashboard option in the system tray menu. Learn more about Rancher Desktop. Learn more about Rancher. Q: Can I have Docker Desktop installed alongside Rancher Desktop?​ A: Yes, but they cannot be run at the same time as both Rancher Desktop and Docker Desktop use the same Docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock). Be sure to stop one before starting the other. Q: How can I perform a clean uninstall of Rancher Desktop?​ A: First, perform a Factory Reset, and then uninstall the app. The uninstall process varies based on the operating system. For more information, please refer here. Q: What support, if any, is available for DNS over VPN on Windows?​ A: An alternative DNS resolver for Windows has been implemented to address some of the VPN issues on Windows. It should support DNS lookup over VPN connections. It has to be enabled manually by editing an internal configuration file. Q: What does the &quot;WSL Integration&quot; tab do?​ A: This makes the Kubernetes configuration accessible in the displayed WSL distributions so that you can use commands such as kubectl to communicate with Kubernetes. Q: Where can I find detailed logs?​ A: Click on the Troubleshooting tab, then click on Show Logs. Q: How can I enable the dashboard for the Traefik ingress controller?​ A: For security reasons, the Traefik dashboard is not exposed by default. However, it is possible to expose the dashboard in multiple ways. For instance, you can use one of the two approaches shown below. Using port-forward to enable dashboard access​ kubectl port-forward -n kube-system $(kubectl -n kube-system get pods --selector &quot;app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik&quot; --output=name) 9000:9000 Visit http://127.0.0.1:9000/dashboard/ in your browser to view the Traefik dashboard. Using HelmChartConfig to enable dashboard access​ Copy the instructions below into a file, for example, expose-traefik.yaml apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: traefik namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- dashboard: enabled: true ports: traefik: expose: true # Avoid this in production deployments logs: access: enabled: true Run the command kubectl apply -f expose-traefik.yaml Visit http://127.0.0.1:9000/dashboard/ in your browser to view the Traefik dashboard. Q: Can I disable Traefik, and will doing so remove Traefik resources?​ A: Yes, you can disable Traefik in order to free up port 80 and 443 for alternate ingress configuration. Disabling Traefik will not delete existing resources. By default, the Enable Traefik feature is selected under Kubernetes Settings; uncheck this box to disable it. If you want to delete Traefik resources, click on Reset Kubernetes on the Kubernetes Settings panel of the UI. Q: Is there support for internal container port forwarding?​ A: Yes, support for this feature is available on all three platforms, Windows, Linux, and macOS, as of v1.1.0. Q: Does file sharing work similarly to Docker Desktop? Do I have to do any additional configuration to mount volumes to VMs?​ A: Currently, the following directories are shared by default: /Users/$USER on macOS, /home/$USER on Linux, and /tmp/rancher-desktop on both. For Windows, all files are automatically shared via WSL2. Standard Docker volumes that are not generally accessible from the host computer work out of the box. To access other directories on Linux/macOS, you will have to perform additional configuration. If you want to change the behavior of the mounts, that will also require additional configuration. Q: Can containers reach back to host services via host.docker.internal?​ A: Yes. On Windows, you may need to create a firewall rule to allow communication between the host and the container. You can run below command in a privileged powershell to create the firewall rule. New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName &quot;WSL&quot; -Direction Inbound -InterfaceAlias &quot;vEthernet (WSL)&quot; -Action Allow Q: I don't need the Kubernetes cluster deployed by Rancher Desktop; how do I disable it to save resources?​ A: Open Rancher Desktop settings, click the cog to open Preferences, select Kuberentes, uncheck Enable Kubernetes feature is selected under Kubernetes Settings; uncheck this box to disable it. This will allow you to run just containerd or dockerd by without allocating resources for Kubernetes. Q: What's happening to the Kubernetes Image Manager (kim)?​ A: As of version 1.0, Kim is no longer shipped and has been replaced by nerdctl and the Docker CLI. Q: Running brew install rancher is failing with a It seems there is already a Binary at '/usr/local/bin/&lt;BINARY&gt;' error, why?​ A: If any of the Rancher Desktop supporting utilities (Helm, kubectl, nerdctl, docker) are already managed by Homebrew, then the installation fails due to how the Homebrew cask formula is defined. Installing using the Mac app will avoid this issue. Q: I installed nerdctl through the Arch User Repository, but it doesn't work with Rancher Desktop, why?​ A: For Rancher Desktop, nerdctl must run inside the VM and not on the host. The host version distributed with Rancher Desktop is just a shell wrapper to execute the command inside the VM. Q: The tools on the Support Utilities page (in Rancher Desktop &lt;1.3.0) are not installed and I see an Insufficient permission to manipulate /usr/local/bin error, how do I fix it?​ A: This occurs when you do not have ownership of /usr/local/bin. A long-term solution to improve the handling of permissions is in the works. In the meantime, a temporary workaround is to change ownership of /usr/local/bin by running sudo chown $USER /usr/local/bin. When you are able to write to the directory, Rancher Desktop should be able to create the symlinks. From versions 1.3.0 and above, we no longer create symlinks in /usr/local/bin but in ~/.rd/bin and put that directory on the PATH instead, to avoid having to deal with write permissions to /usr/local/bin and file conflicts. We strongly recommend you to upgrade to the latest version of Rancher Desktop. Q: Is Cygwin compatible with Rancher Desktop?​ A: No, but there are plans to add compatibility. Q: How can I add Rancher Desktop to the startup programs list on Windows?​ A: On Windows, you can add a program to startup programs list in a number of ways.

See below for details. It is also recommended to have: 8 GB of memory4 CPU Additional resources may be required depending on the workloads you plan to run. Ensuring You Have Access to /dev/kvm​ On some distributions (Ubuntu 18.04 for example) the user has insufficient privileges to use /dev/kvm, which is required for Rancher Desktop. To check whether you have the required privileges, do: [ -r /dev/kvm ] &amp;&amp; [ -w /dev/kvm ] || echo 'insufficient privileges'  If it outputs insufficient privileges, you need to add your user to thekvm group. You can do this with: sudo usermod -a -G kvm &quot;$USER&quot;  Then reboot in order to make these changes take effect. pass Setup​ By default, Rancher Desktop uses pass to securely store credentials passed via docker login and nerdctl login. pass requires a small amount of setup if this is the first time it has been used on your machine. If you don't intend to use docker login or nerdctl login you don't have to set uppass - just remember that if you use them in the future, you must set it up or you will run into errors. Once Rancher Desktop is installed, you should create a GPG key. This will be used by pass to secure secrets. You can create a GPG key with: gpg --generate-key  The output should contain something like 8D818FB37A9279E341F01506ED96AD27A40C9C73. This is your key ID. You can then initialize pass by passing this key ID to it: pass init 8D818FB37A9279E341F01506ED96AD27A40C9C73  For more information on pass, please see its website. Traefik Port Binding Access​ Rancher Desktop makes use of Traefik as the default ingress controller. Users may run into a permission denied error after deploying Rancher Desktop due to restricted port access on the Traefik ingress. Most Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu 20.04) do not allow non-root users to listen on TCP and UDP ports below 1024. In order to allow Traefik to listen to privileged ports on the local host, please run the following command: sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80  After the command is run, all ports 80 and above will become unprivileged and Traefik will be able to successfully access said ports. To preserve this change across reboots as a custom kernel parameter setting, add the same command inside your /etc/sysctl.conf file.

"},{"title":"Existing Deployments​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Running When Offline","url":"1.9-tech-preview/how-to-guides/running-air-gapped#existing-deployments","content":"If Rancher Desktop has been installed on a machine initially with networked access, it can be run subsequently on that machine after network connectivity has been turned off. The main difference in core functionality is that the list of versions of Kubernetes available in drop-down menus is limited to those versions that have actually been downloaded and stored in the cache. There is a problem using the kubectl client, because of the kuberlr wrapper (Windows users should add the .exe suffix to each executable utility file). In this case, we're discussing a system that was initialized when connected to the internet, but we're about to take the machine offline for future use. Suppose there are three versions of k3s in the rancher-desktop cache. 1.24.3 1.21.14 1.19.16 But suppose that on this system we only ran kubectl when using versions 1.24.3 and 1.21.14. This means that the ~/.kuberlr/PLATFORM-ARCH/ directory ($env:HOMEDRIVE%\\$env:HOMEPATH/.kuberlr/windows-amd64 on Windows) will contain only two files: kubectl1.24.3 kubectl1.21.14 If we go offline and use the UI to switch to Kubernetes 1.19.16, when kubectl is run, the system will fail. The problem is that kubectl is an alias for kuberlr, which will try to download kubectl 1.19.16 and install it in the .kuberlr directory, but won't be able to access it. So in this case, it would be best to prepare a connected system for disconnecting by selecting each available version of Kubernetes currently in the cache, and running kubectl --context rancher-desktop cluster-info to ensure that an appropriate version of the kubectl client is installed. You could install versioned kubectls manually. This is covered in the next section.

There are two directories that need to be populated in order for Rancher Desktop to function off-line: The Cache Directory​ To populate a source disk (which we refer to here as %SOURCEDISK%, although it is probably some kind of removable medium like a USB thumb drive), you need the following files: k3s-versions.json -- this file is created by Rancher Desktop. It reads a raw JSON file from https://update.k3s.io/v1-release/channels and converts it into a different kind of JSON file. Currently there is no utility to do that conversion; the easiest way to get this file is to run Rancher Desktop on a connected system and save the CACHE/k3s-versions.json file (see below for where CACHE exists on different platforms).Tar archives of Kubernetes K3s images. These are listed at https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases.

For example, the following commands will let you work with K3s v1.24.3 build 1 offline: cd .../CACHE mkdir v1.24.3+k3s1 cd v1.24.3+k3s1 wget https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.24.3%2Bk3s1/k3s-airgap-images-amd64.tar wget https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.24.3%2Bk3s1/sha256sum-amd64.txt wget https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.24.3%2Bk3s1/k3s  WindowsmacOSLinux On Linux, the cache directory is at $HOME/.cache/rancher-desktop and the commands to populate it would be CACHEDIR=$HOME/.cache/rancher-desktop mkdir -p $CACHEDIR/k3s cp $SOURCEDISK/k3s-versions.json $CACHEDIR/ cp -r $SOURCEDISK/v&lt;MAJOR&gt;.&lt;MINOR&gt;.&lt;PATCH&gt;+k3s&lt;BUILD&gt; $CACHEDIR/k3s/  The kuberlr Directory​ The location of this directory is more straightforward. On all platforms, it's at HOME/.kuberlr/PLATFORM-ARCH where: HOME is the home directory: usually $env:HOMEDRIVE%\\$env:HOMEPATH on Windows, and ~ or $HOME on macOS and Linux.PLATFORM is one of windows, linux, or darwin.ARCH is aarch64 on M1 machines, and amd64 everywhere else. To populate it, determine which versions of Kubernetes you'll be using, and download the appropriate executables from the internet. These would be in: WindowsmacOSLinux https://dl.k8s.io/VERSION/bin/PLATFORM/CPU/kubectl Where: VERSION will have the form vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (like v1.22.1),PLATFORM will be one of darwin, linux, or windows,CPU will arm64 on M1 machines and amd64 everywhere else. For example, to get a kubectl for Windows that will work with Kubernetes v1.22, this Windows command-shell (not PowerShell) command will put it on the SOURCEDISK: wget -O %SOURCEDISK/kubectl1.22.1.exe https://dl.k8s.io/v1.22.1/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe  A Note on Versions​ Kubectl clients are guaranteed to work with servers that are running the same MAJOR version and differ in the MINOR version by at most 1. So for example, if your organization is working with Kubernetes versions v1.21.x, v1.22.x, and v1.23.x, for any patch-version of x, you would only need to install kubectl1.22.x in the .kuberlr directory. But if you copy a v1.24.x of Kubernetes into the CACHE directory, you'll need to ensure there's a compatible kubectl in the .kuberlr directory as well (any of v1.23.x, v1.24.x, or v1.25.x would suffice).

Skaffold handles the workflow for building, pushing, and deploying your application, and it provides building blocks for creating CI/CD pipelines. This enables you to focus on iterating on your application locally while Skaffold continuously deploys to your local or remote Kubernetes cluster. To learn more about Skaffold, refer to the project docs here. In order to demonstrate the steps to set up Skaffold with Rancher Desktop, a sample nodejs app example is provided within the Rancher Desktop docs repository here. Important: Skaffold only works with dockerd (Moby). Therefore, make sure to select your runtime as dockerd from the Kubernetes Settings panel in the Rancher Desktop UI. Visit https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/ to install Skaffold. Clone the Rancher Desktop docs repository and navigate to the express-sample in a terminal as follows: cd docs.rancherdesktop.io/assets/express-sample Run skaffold init. Per the Skaffold docs,skaffold init walks through your project directory and looks for any build configuration files such as Dockerfile, build.gradle/pom.xml, package.json, requirements.txt, or go.mod. We will select Dockerfile and package.json in our example. This will generate the initial configuration file that you can modify as needed. When prompted, select yes to write your config to skaffold.yaml. In your editor, review your app.js and manifests.yaml files. Note that in manifests.yaml, you will have a deployment config as well as a service config. It is only necessary to have 1 replica for testing purposes. Back in your terminal, you'll notice that you will have two options: skaffold run that lets you build and deploy, and skaffold dev that allows you to enter development mode with auto-redeploy. We will use skaffold dev in this example. As you will need to have push access to the image repository, you can either use your docker login, or you can set up a local registry: Docker HubLocal Registry Before running skaffold dev, use your docker login if you have a Docker Hub account. Then, in the files skaffold.yaml and manifests.yaml replace matamagu/express-sample for YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/express-sample as skaffold dev will push the built image to DockerHub. As you go through your development, Skaffold will detect any changes and will automatically go through the build and deployment process again. You will be able to see any changes reflected in the cluster.

From here, you can debug the application as if it's running on your host.   Sometimes, the application might not break at the set breakpoint on the first run as the debugging process may not have started. In this case, refresh the browser to trigger the execution again to hit the breakpoint. You can also get around this behavior by setting the property inspectMode: 'break' in task.json file to prevent the app from running until the debugger attaches. On some machines, the firewall settings might prevent the debugging process from establishing a connection between the host and the container processes. In this case, you can add a firewall rule to allow communication between the VM where the container is running and the host where you have the VS Code session running.

Q: Why do I not see my WSL distro under Rancher Desktop's WSL Integration page?​ A: You are likely using a WSL 1 distro. Rancher Desktop supports only WSL 2 distros. You can convert your WSL 1 distro into a WSL 2 distro by running the command wsl --set-version &lt;distro-name&gt; 2. You can also run the command wsl --set-default-version 2 to set all the future distributions you might install to use WSL 2. Q: I do not see an entry for Rancher Desktop when running kubectl config get-contexts, where is it?​ A: Rancher Desktop places its configuration in the default location, ~/.kube/config, and uses that. Your KUBECONFIG environment variable may be set to look elsewhere for configuration files. Q: Rancher Desktop is stuck on Waiting for Kubernetes API, what do I do?​ A: The cause is hard to determine without additional information. Navigate to the Troubleshooting tab and use the button to access the logs. Then go to the Rancher Desktop GitHub page and file an issue with the logs attached. Q: I can no longer run docker compose after installing Rancher Desktop and uninstalling Docker Desktop, what happened?​ A: This was an issue related to earlier versions (prior to 1.1.0) of Rancher Desktop. Rancher Desktop version 1.1.0 and above comes bundled with docker-compose for you, and makes the cli plugins available at ~/.docker/cli-plugins. We strongly recommend you to be on the latest version of Rancher Desktop. If you still don't see docker-compose available then please file a bug on Github. Q: I'm using Homebrew to install Rancher Desktop, but brew install rancher-desktop is failing, why?​ A: Due to the Homebrew cask naming conventions, the -desktop suffix is dropped from the cask formula name. Use brew install rancher instead. Q: How do I fix permission denied errors when trying to use Docker on WSL?​ A: You need write-permission to access the docker socket. There are many ways to go about that, but this is one of the more common approaches. Using the Ubuntu WSL command-line: sudo groupadd docker sudo adduser $USER docker sudo chown root:docker /var/run/docker.sock sudo chmod g+w /var/run/docker.sock newgrp docker Q: How do I fix kubectl: command not found issue on Linux?​ A: By default, Rancher Desktop creates symlinks of kubectl, docker, helm and nerdctl binaries in the /home/&lt;user&gt;/.local/bin directory on Linux. To be able to call these commands directly from the console you may add the directory to your PATH environment variable by executing the following command in console and performing logout and login: echo &quot;export PATH=\\$PATH:/home/$(whoami)/.local/bin&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc Q: How do I fix FATA[0005] subnet 10.4.0.0/24 overlaps with other one on this address space when running a container using nerdctl run?​ A: You will see this error if there's a route rule with an IP address from a conflicting subnet on the Iptables. The conflicting routes could be either from the host network (bridge mode) or the Kubernetes network. A quick workaround to this issue is to shutdown WSL via the command wsl --shutdown. ⚠️ Please note that shutting down WSL will stop all other distros along with the rancher-desktop distro. Q: How do I fix the Installation Aborted error while downgrading from an existing MSI installation to an older EXE version (1.6.x or earlier) on Windows?​ A: You will see this error if the Windows registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventLog\\Application\\RancherDesktopPrivilegedService that is supposed to be deleted during the MSI uninstallation process is not deleted for some reason. Please manually delete the registry key and try installing the EXE version. You can run the below command in a privileged shell to delete the registry key. reg.exe delete HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventLog\\Application\\RancherDesktopPrivilegedService /reg:64 /f Q: Why do I see a blank screen when I launch the Cluster Dashboard?​ A: The Cluster Dashboard may not be running correctly because another process on your machine is using ports 9080 or 9443 that the Dashboard process (steve) depends on. To solve this, identify and terminate the process using those ports. You can use the command below to identify processes using a specific port on your host machine. Note that on macOS and Linux, the Rancher Dashboard process is named steve, while on Windows, it's steve.exe. If steve is the only process using ports 9080 or 9443, do not terminate it.

Q: Is Rancher Desktop a desktop version of Rancher?​ A: No. Rancher Desktop is not Rancher on the Desktop. While Rancher and Rancher Desktop share the Rancher name, they do different things. But, the two solutions do complement each other: Rancher is a complete software stack for managing multiple Kubernetes clusters across any infrastructure. Rancher Desktop provides container management and a Kubernetes instance on the desktop to support local development use cases. Q: Is there a Kubernetes Cluster Explorer available in Rancher Desktop?​ A: Yes, the Rancher Dashboard is included as a feature preview in the release 1.2.1. Invoke the dashboard by clicking on Dashboard option in the system tray menu. Learn more about Rancher Desktop. Learn more about Rancher. Q: Can I have Docker Desktop installed alongside Rancher Desktop?​ A: Yes, but they cannot be run at the same time as both Rancher Desktop and Docker Desktop use the same Docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock). Be sure to stop one before starting the other. Q: How can I perform a clean uninstall of Rancher Desktop?​ A: First, perform a Factory Reset, and then uninstall the app. The uninstall process varies based on the operating system. For more information, please refer here. Q: What support, if any, is available for DNS over VPN on Windows?​ A: An alternative DNS resolver for Windows has been implemented to address some of the VPN issues on Windows. It should support DNS lookup over VPN connections. It has to be enabled manually by editing an internal configuration file. Q: What does the &quot;WSL Integration&quot; tab do?​ A: This makes the Kubernetes configuration accessible in the displayed WSL distributions so that you can use commands such as kubectl to communicate with Kubernetes. Q: Where can I find detailed logs?​ A: Click on the Troubleshooting tab, then click on Show Logs. Q: How can I enable the dashboard for the Traefik ingress controller?​ A: For security reasons, the Traefik dashboard is not exposed by default. However, it is possible to expose the dashboard in multiple ways. For instance, you can use one of the two approaches shown below. Using port-forward to enable dashboard access​ kubectl port-forward -n kube-system $(kubectl -n kube-system get pods --selector &quot;app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik&quot; --output=name) 9000:9000 Visit http://127.0.0.1:9000/dashboard/ in your browser to view the Traefik dashboard. Using HelmChartConfig to enable dashboard access​ Copy the instructions below into a file, for example, expose-traefik.yaml apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: traefik namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- dashboard: enabled: true ports: traefik: expose: true # Avoid this in production deployments logs: access: enabled: true Run the command kubectl apply -f expose-traefik.yaml Visit http://127.0.0.1:9000/dashboard/ in your browser to view the Traefik dashboard. Q: Can I disable Traefik, and will doing so remove Traefik resources?​ A: Yes, you can disable Traefik in order to free up port 80 and 443 for alternate ingress configuration. Disabling Traefik will not delete existing resources. By default, the Enable Traefik feature is selected under Kubernetes Settings; uncheck this box to disable it. If you want to delete Traefik resources, click on Reset Kubernetes on the Kubernetes Settings panel of the UI. Q: Is there support for internal container port forwarding?​ A: Yes, support for this feature is available on all three platforms, Windows, Linux, and macOS, as of v1.1.0. Q: Does file sharing work similarly to Docker Desktop? Do I have to do any additional configuration to mount volumes to VMs?​ A: Currently, the following directories are shared by default: /Users/$USER on macOS, /home/$USER on Linux, and /tmp/rancher-desktop on both. For Windows, all files are automatically shared via WSL2. Standard Docker volumes that are not generally accessible from the host computer work out of the box. To access other directories on Linux/macOS, you will have to perform additional configuration. If you want to change the behavior of the mounts, that will also require additional configuration. Q: Can containers reach back to host services via host.docker.internal?​ A: Yes. On Windows, you may need to create a firewall rule to allow communication between the host and the container.

New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName &quot;WSL&quot; -Direction Inbound -InterfaceAlias &quot;vEthernet (WSL)&quot; -Action Allow Q: I don't need the Kubernetes cluster deployed by Rancher Desktop; how do I disable it to save resources?​ A: Open Rancher Desktop settings, click the cog to open Preferences, select Kuberentes, uncheck Enable Kubernetes feature is selected under Kubernetes Settings; uncheck this box to disable it. This will allow you to run just containerd or dockerd by without allocating resources for Kubernetes. Q: What's happening to the Kubernetes Image Manager (kim)?​ A: As of version 1.0, Kim is no longer shipped and has been replaced by nerdctl and the Docker CLI. Q: Running brew install rancher is failing with a It seems there is already a Binary at '/usr/local/bin/&lt;BINARY&gt;' error, why?​ A: If any of the Rancher Desktop supporting utilities (Helm, kubectl, nerdctl, docker) are already managed by Homebrew, then the installation fails due to how the Homebrew cask formula is defined. Installing using the Mac app will avoid this issue. Q: I installed nerdctl through the Arch User Repository, but it doesn't work with Rancher Desktop, why?​ A: For Rancher Desktop, nerdctl must run inside the VM and not on the host. The host version distributed with Rancher Desktop is just a shell wrapper to execute the command inside the VM. Q: The tools on the Support Utilities page (in Rancher Desktop &lt;1.3.0) are not installed and I see an Insufficient permission to manipulate /usr/local/bin error, how do I fix it?​ A: This occurs when you do not have ownership of /usr/local/bin. A long-term solution to improve the handling of permissions is in the works. In the meantime, a temporary workaround is to change ownership of /usr/local/bin by running sudo chown $USER /usr/local/bin. When you are able to write to the directory, Rancher Desktop should be able to create the symlinks. From versions 1.3.0 and above, we no longer create symlinks in /usr/local/bin but in ~/.rd/bin and put that directory on the PATH instead, to avoid having to deal with write permissions to /usr/local/bin and file conflicts. We strongly recommend you to upgrade to the latest version of Rancher Desktop. Q: Is Cygwin compatible with Rancher Desktop?​ A: No, but there are plans to add compatibility. Q: How can I add Rancher Desktop to the startup programs list on Windows?​ A: On Windows, you can add a program to startup programs list in a number of ways. For example, you can use the following steps. Press Windows+R to open the Run dialog box.Type shell:startup and then hit Enter to open the Startup folder.Copy &quot;Rancher Desktop&quot; shortcut from Desktop and paste in Startup folder.Restart your machine. Q: Where does Rancher Desktop actually put the data volumes?​ A: Windows:Open Run menu (Press Windows + R) and open the path provided below, depending on the active container runtime. dockerd(moby): \\\\wsl$\\rancher-desktop-data\\var\\lib\\docker\\volumes containerd: \\\\wsl$\\rancher-desktop-data\\var\\lib\\nerdctl\\dbb19c5e\\volumes\\&lt;namespace&gt; macOS &amp; Linux:Navigate to the path provided below in the (lima) VM, depending on the active container runtime. You can use rdctl shell to access these paths in the VM. dockerd(moby): /var/lib/docker/volumes containerd: /var/lib/nerdctl/dbb19c5e/volumes/&lt;namespace&gt; Q: How can I downgrade Rancher Desktop to a non-current (older) release version​ A: We strongly recommend you use the current release version as it has the latest features and bug fixes included. However, if you want to downgrade to an earlier version, please follow the steps below. Perform Troubleshooting &gt; Factory Reset from the current installation. Please make sure the Keep cached Kubernetes images box is not checked in the Factory Reset pop up dialog.Uninstall the current version by following uninstallation instructions for your OS.Install the older version that you need.","keywords":""},{"title":"Deployment Profiles","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"next/getting-started/deployment","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Preferences Values at Startup​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Deployment Profiles","url":"next/getting-started/deployment#preferences-values-at-startup","content":"Rancher Desktop settings are determined as follows: Load &quot;admin&quot; deployment profile (both &quot;defaults&quot; and &quot;locked&quot;)If neither of them exist then load &quot;user&quot; deployment profile (again both &quot;defaults&quot; and &quot;locked&quot;)Load saved preferences from settings.json fileIf there are no saved settings, use the &quot;defaults&quot; profile loaded earlier insteadCopy values from command-line arguments used to launch the app into settingsIf the settings are still completely empty, show the first-run dialogFill any missing values from the builtin application defaultsCopy values from the &quot;locked&quot; profile over the current settings The user cannot modify any settings (via GUI or CLI) that have been locked by the profile.

See below for details. It is also recommended to have: 8 GB of memory4 CPU Additional resources may be required depending on the workloads you plan to run. Ensuring You Have Access to /dev/kvm​ On some distributions (Ubuntu 18.04 for example) the user has insufficient privileges to use /dev/kvm, which is required for Rancher Desktop. To check whether you have the required privileges, do: [ -r /dev/kvm ] &amp;&amp; [ -w /dev/kvm ] || echo 'insufficient privileges'  If it outputs insufficient privileges, you need to add your user to thekvm group. You can do this with: sudo usermod -a -G kvm &quot;$USER&quot;  Then reboot in order to make these changes take effect. pass Setup​ By default, Rancher Desktop uses pass to securely store credentials passed via docker login and nerdctl login. pass requires a small amount of setup if this is the first time it has been used on your machine. If you don't intend to use docker login or nerdctl login you don't have to set uppass - just remember that if you use them in the future, you must set it up or you will run into errors. Once Rancher Desktop is installed, you should create a GPG key. This will be used by pass to secure secrets. You can create a GPG key with: gpg --generate-key  The output should contain something like 8D818FB37A9279E341F01506ED96AD27A40C9C73. This is your key ID. You can then initialize pass by passing this key ID to it: pass init 8D818FB37A9279E341F01506ED96AD27A40C9C73  For more information on pass, please see its website. Traefik Port Binding Access​ Rancher Desktop makes use of Traefik as the default ingress controller. Users may run into a permission denied error after deploying Rancher Desktop due to restricted port access on the Traefik ingress. Most Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu 20.04) do not allow non-root users to listen on TCP and UDP ports below 1024. In order to allow Traefik to listen to privileged ports on the local host, please run the following command: sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80  After the command is run, all ports 80 and above will become unprivileged and Traefik will be able to successfully access said ports. To preserve this change across reboots as a custom kernel parameter setting, add the same command inside your /etc/sysctl.conf file.

"},{"title":"Existing Deployments​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Running When Offline","url":"next/how-to-guides/running-air-gapped#existing-deployments","content":"If Rancher Desktop has been installed on a machine initially with networked access, it can be run subsequently on that machine after network connectivity has been turned off. The main difference in core functionality is that the list of versions of Kubernetes available in drop-down menus is limited to those versions that have actually been downloaded and stored in the cache. There is a problem using the kubectl client, because of the kuberlr wrapper (Windows users should add the .exe suffix to each executable utility file). In this case, we're discussing a system that was initialized when connected to the internet, but we're about to take the machine offline for future use. Suppose there are three versions of k3s in the rancher-desktop cache. 1.24.3 1.21.14 1.19.16 But suppose that on this system we only ran kubectl when using versions 1.24.3 and 1.21.14. This means that the ~/.kuberlr/PLATFORM-ARCH/ directory ($env:HOMEDRIVE%\\$env:HOMEPATH/.kuberlr/windows-amd64 on Windows) will contain only two files: kubectl1.24.3 kubectl1.21.14 If we go offline and use the UI to switch to Kubernetes 1.19.16, when kubectl is run, the system will fail. The problem is that kubectl is an alias for kuberlr, which will try to download kubectl 1.19.16 and install it in the .kuberlr directory, but won't be able to access it. So in this case, it would be best to prepare a connected system for disconnecting by selecting each available version of Kubernetes currently in the cache, and running kubectl --context rancher-desktop cluster-info to ensure that an appropriate version of the kubectl client is installed. You could install versioned kubectls manually. This is covered in the next section.

There are two directories that need to be populated in order for Rancher Desktop to function off-line: The Cache Directory​ To populate a source disk (which we refer to here as %SOURCEDISK%, although it is probably some kind of removable medium like a USB thumb drive), you need the following files: k3s-versions.json -- this file is created by Rancher Desktop. It reads a raw JSON file from https://update.k3s.io/v1-release/channels and converts it into a different kind of JSON file. Currently there is no utility to do that conversion; the easiest way to get this file is to run Rancher Desktop on a connected system and save the CACHE/k3s-versions.json file (see below for where CACHE exists on different platforms).Tar archives of Kubernetes K3s images. These are listed at https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases. You'll want to download either the k3s-airgap-images-amd64.tar for AMD/Intel machines, k3s-airgap-images-arm64.tar for M1 machines, or the respective *.tar.zst compressed tarball if you are using k3s v1.26.1 and above. Finally you'll need to download the k3s executable for the selected version. For example, the following commands will let you work with K3s v1.24.3 build 1 offline: cd .../CACHE mkdir v1.24.3+k3s1 cd v1.24.3+k3s1 wget https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.24.3%2Bk3s1/k3s-airgap-images-amd64.tar wget https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.24.3%2Bk3s1/sha256sum-amd64.txt wget https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.24.3%2Bk3s1/k3s  WindowsmacOSLinux On Linux, the cache directory is at $HOME/.cache/rancher-desktop and the commands to populate it would be CACHEDIR=$HOME/.cache/rancher-desktop mkdir -p $CACHEDIR/k3s cp $SOURCEDISK/k3s-versions.json $CACHEDIR/ cp -r $SOURCEDISK/v&lt;MAJOR&gt;.&lt;MINOR&gt;.&lt;PATCH&gt;+k3s&lt;BUILD&gt; $CACHEDIR/k3s/  The kuberlr Directory​ The location of this directory is more straightforward. On all platforms, it's at HOME/.kuberlr/PLATFORM-ARCH where: HOME is the home directory: usually $env:HOMEDRIVE%\\$env:HOMEPATH on Windows, and ~ or $HOME on macOS and Linux.PLATFORM is one of windows, linux, or darwin.ARCH is aarch64 on M1 machines, and amd64 everywhere else. To populate it, determine which versions of Kubernetes you'll be using, and download the appropriate executables from the internet. These would be in: WindowsmacOSLinux https://dl.k8s.io/VERSION/bin/PLATFORM/CPU/kubectl Where: VERSION will have the form vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (like v1.22.1),PLATFORM will be one of darwin, linux, or windows,CPU will arm64 on M1 machines and amd64 everywhere else. For example, to get a kubectl for Windows that will work with Kubernetes v1.22, this Windows command-shell (not PowerShell) command will put it on the SOURCEDISK: wget -O %SOURCEDISK/kubectl1.22.1.exe https://dl.k8s.io/v1.22.1/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe  A Note on Versions​ Kubectl clients are guaranteed to work with servers that are running the same MAJOR version and differ in the MINOR version by at most 1. So for example, if your organization is working with Kubernetes versions v1.21.x, v1.22.x, and v1.23.x, for any patch-version of x, you would only need to install kubectl1.22.x in the .kuberlr directory. But if you copy a v1.24.x of Kubernetes into the CACHE directory, you'll need to ensure there's a compatible kubectl in the .kuberlr directory as well (any of v1.23.x, v1.24.x, or v1.25.x would suffice).

Skaffold handles the workflow for building, pushing, and deploying your application, and it provides building blocks for creating CI/CD pipelines. This enables you to focus on iterating on your application locally while Skaffold continuously deploys to your local or remote Kubernetes cluster. To learn more about Skaffold, refer to the project docs here. In order to demonstrate the steps to set up Skaffold with Rancher Desktop, a sample nodejs app example is provided within the Rancher Desktop docs repository here. Important: Skaffold only works with dockerd (Moby). Therefore, make sure to select your runtime as dockerd from the Kubernetes Settings panel in the Rancher Desktop UI. Visit https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/ to install Skaffold. Clone the Rancher Desktop docs repository and navigate to the express-sample in a terminal as follows: cd docs.rancherdesktop.io/assets/express-sample Run skaffold init. Per the Skaffold docs,skaffold init walks through your project directory and looks for any build configuration files such as Dockerfile, build.gradle/pom.xml, package.json, requirements.txt, or go.mod. We will select Dockerfile and package.json in our example. This will generate the initial configuration file that you can modify as needed. When prompted, select yes to write your config to skaffold.yaml. In your editor, review your app.js and manifests.yaml files. Note that in manifests.yaml, you will have a deployment config as well as a service config. It is only necessary to have 1 replica for testing purposes. Back in your terminal, you'll notice that you will have two options: skaffold run that lets you build and deploy, and skaffold dev that allows you to enter development mode with auto-redeploy. We will use skaffold dev in this example. As you will need to have push access to the image repository, you can either use your docker login, or you can set up a local registry: Docker HubLocal Registry Before running skaffold dev, use your docker login if you have a Docker Hub account. Then, in the files skaffold.yaml and manifests.yaml replace matamagu/express-sample for YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/express-sample as skaffold dev will push the built image to DockerHub. As you go through your development, Skaffold will detect any changes and will automatically go through the build and deployment process again. You will be able to see any changes reflected in the cluster.

Q: How can I fix the Docker error when starting a container using the VS Code dev-containers extension with version &gt;v0.266?​ A: There is a current workaround for users experiencing a Docker error when starting a container using the dev-containers extension for VS code versioned v0.266 or later and Rancher Desktop v1.8.1. Disabling Wayland in the user settings will allow the container to spin up successfully. This can be accomplished by unchecking the box in the Settings &gt; Extensions &gt; Dev Containers tab labelled Dev &gt; Containers: Mount Wayland Socket (Applies to All Profiles). Q: Why do I not see my WSL distro under Rancher Desktop's WSL Integration page?​ A: You are likely using a WSL 1 distro. Rancher Desktop supports only WSL 2 distros. You can convert your WSL 1 distro into a WSL 2 distro by running the command wsl --set-version &lt;distro-name&gt; 2. You can also run the command wsl --set-default-version 2 to set all the future distributions you might install to use WSL 2. Q: I do not see an entry for Rancher Desktop when running kubectl config get-contexts, where is it?​ A: Rancher Desktop places its configuration in the default location, ~/.kube/config, and uses that. Your KUBECONFIG environment variable may be set to look elsewhere for configuration files. Q: Rancher Desktop is stuck on Waiting for Kubernetes API, what do I do?​ A: The cause is hard to determine without additional information. Navigate to the Troubleshooting tab and use the button to access the logs. Then go to the Rancher Desktop GitHub page and file an issue with the logs attached. Q: I can no longer run docker compose after installing Rancher Desktop and uninstalling Docker Desktop, what happened?​ A: This was an issue related to earlier versions (prior to 1.1.0) of Rancher Desktop. Rancher Desktop version 1.1.0 and above comes bundled with docker-compose for you, and makes the cli plugins available at ~/.docker/cli-plugins. We strongly recommend you to be on the latest version of Rancher Desktop. If you still don't see docker-compose available then please file a bug on Github. Q: I'm using Homebrew to install Rancher Desktop, but brew install rancher-desktop is failing, why?​ A: Due to the Homebrew cask naming conventions, the -desktop suffix is dropped from the cask formula name. Use brew install rancher instead. Q: How do I fix permission denied errors when trying to use Docker on WSL?​ A: You need write-permission to access the docker socket. There are many ways to go about that, but this is one of the more common approaches. Using the Ubuntu WSL command-line: sudo groupadd docker sudo adduser $USER docker sudo chown root:docker /var/run/docker.sock sudo chmod g+w /var/run/docker.sock newgrp docker Q: How do I fix kubectl: command not found issue on Linux?​ A: By default, Rancher Desktop creates symlinks of kubectl, docker, helm and nerdctl binaries in the /home/&lt;user&gt;/.local/bin directory on Linux. To be able to call these commands directly from the console you may add the directory to your PATH environment variable by executing the following command in console and performing logout and login: echo &quot;export PATH=\\$PATH:/home/$(whoami)/.local/bin&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc Q: How do I fix FATA[0005] subnet 10.4.0.0/24 overlaps with other one on this address space when running a container using nerdctl run?​ A: You will see this error if there's a route rule with an IP address from a conflicting subnet on the Iptables. The conflicting routes could be either from the host network (bridge mode) or the Kubernetes network. A quick workaround to this issue is to shutdown WSL via the command wsl --shutdown. ⚠️ Please note that shutting down WSL will stop all other distros along with the rancher-desktop distro. Q: How do I fix the Installation Aborted error while downgrading from an existing MSI installation to an older EXE version (1.6.x or earlier) on Windows?​ A: You will see this error if the Windows registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventLog\\Application\\RancherDesktopPrivilegedService that is supposed to be deleted during the MSI uninstallation process is not deleted for some reason. Please manually delete the registry key and try installing the EXE version. You can run the below command in a privileged shell to delete the registry key. reg.exe delete HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventLog\\Application\\RancherDesktopPrivilegedService /reg:64 /f Q: Why do I see a blank screen when I launch the Cluster Dashboard?​ A: The Cluster Dashboard may not be running correctly because another process on your machine is using ports 9080 or 9443 that the Dashboard process (steve) depends on. To solve this, identify and terminate the process using those ports. You can use the command below to identify processes using a specific port on your host machine. Note that on macOS and Linux, the Rancher Dashboard process is named steve, while on Windows, it's steve.exe. If steve is the only process using ports 9080 or 9443, do not terminate it.

Q: Is Rancher Desktop a desktop version of Rancher?​ A: No. Rancher Desktop is not Rancher on the Desktop. While Rancher and Rancher Desktop share the Rancher name, they do different things. But, the two solutions do complement each other: Rancher is a complete software stack for managing multiple Kubernetes clusters across any infrastructure. Rancher Desktop provides container management and a Kubernetes instance on the desktop to support local development use cases. Q: Is there a Kubernetes Cluster Explorer available in Rancher Desktop?​ A: Yes, the Rancher Dashboard is included as a feature preview in the release 1.2.1. Invoke the dashboard by clicking on Dashboard option in the system tray menu. Learn more about Rancher Desktop. Learn more about Rancher. Q: Can I have Docker Desktop installed alongside Rancher Desktop?​ A: Yes, but they cannot be run at the same time as both Rancher Desktop and Docker Desktop use the same Docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock). Be sure to stop one before starting the other. Q: How can I perform a clean uninstall of Rancher Desktop?​ A: First, perform a Factory Reset, and then uninstall the app. The uninstall process varies based on the operating system. For more information, please refer here. Q: What support, if any, is available for DNS over VPN on Windows?​ A: An alternative DNS resolver for Windows has been implemented to address some of the VPN issues on Windows. It should support DNS lookup over VPN connections. It has to be enabled manually by editing an internal configuration file. Q: What does the &quot;WSL Integration&quot; tab do?​ A: This makes the Kubernetes configuration accessible in the displayed WSL distributions so that you can use commands such as kubectl to communicate with Kubernetes. Q: Where can I find detailed logs?​ A: Click on the Troubleshooting tab, then click on Show Logs. Q: How can I enable the dashboard for the Traefik ingress controller?​ A: For security reasons, the Traefik dashboard is not exposed by default. However, it is possible to expose the dashboard in multiple ways. For instance, you can use one of the two approaches shown below. Using port-forward to enable dashboard access​ kubectl port-forward -n kube-system $(kubectl -n kube-system get pods --selector &quot;app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik&quot; --output=name) 9000:9000 Visit http://127.0.0.1:9000/dashboard/ in your browser to view the Traefik dashboard. Using HelmChartConfig to enable dashboard access​ Copy the instructions below into a file, for example, expose-traefik.yaml apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: traefik namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- dashboard: enabled: true ports: traefik: expose: true # Avoid this in production deployments logs: access: enabled: true Run the command kubectl apply -f expose-traefik.yaml Visit http://127.0.0.1:9000/dashboard/ in your browser to view the Traefik dashboard. Q: Can I disable Traefik, and will doing so remove Traefik resources?​ A: Yes, you can disable Traefik in order to free up port 80 and 443 for alternate ingress configuration. Disabling Traefik will not delete existing resources. By default, the Enable Traefik feature is selected under Kubernetes Settings; uncheck this box to disable it. If you want to delete Traefik resources, click on Reset Kubernetes on the Kubernetes Settings panel of the UI. Q: Is there support for internal container port forwarding?​ A: Yes, support for this feature is available on all three platforms, Windows, Linux, and macOS, as of v1.1.0. Q: Does file sharing work similarly to Docker Desktop? Do I have to do any additional configuration to mount volumes to VMs?​ A: Currently, the following directories are shared by default: /Users/$USER on macOS, /home/$USER on Linux, and /tmp/rancher-desktop on both. For Windows, all files are automatically shared via WSL2. Standard Docker volumes that are not generally accessible from the host computer work out of the box. To access other directories on Linux/macOS, you will have to perform additional configuration. If you want to change the behavior of the mounts, that will also require additional configuration. Q: Can containers reach back to host services via host.docker.internal?​ A: Yes. On Windows, you may need to create a firewall rule to allow communication between the host and the container. You can run below command in a privileged powershell to create the firewall rule. New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName &quot;WSL&quot; -Direction Inbound -InterfaceAlias &quot;vEthernet (WSL)&quot; -Action Allow Q: I don't need the Kubernetes cluster deployed by Rancher Desktop; how do I disable it to save resources?​ A: Open Rancher Desktop settings, click the cog to open Preferences, select Kuberentes, uncheck Enable Kubernetes feature is selected under Kubernetes Settings; uncheck this box to disable it. This will allow you to run just containerd or dockerd by without allocating resources for Kubernetes. Q: What's happening to the Kubernetes Image Manager (kim)?​ A: As of version 1.0, Kim is no longer shipped and has been replaced by nerdctl and the Docker CLI. Q: Running brew install rancher is failing with a It seems there is already a Binary at '/usr/local/bin/&lt;BINARY&gt;' error, why?​ A: If any of the Rancher Desktop supporting utilities (Helm, kubectl, nerdctl, docker) are already managed by Homebrew, then the installation fails due to how the Homebrew cask formula is defined. Installing using the Mac app will avoid this issue. Q: I installed nerdctl through the Arch User Repository, but it doesn't work with Rancher Desktop, why?​ A: For Rancher Desktop, nerdctl must run inside the VM and not on the host. The host version distributed with Rancher Desktop is just a shell wrapper to execute the command inside the VM. Q: The tools on the Support Utilities page (in Rancher Desktop &lt;1.3.0) are not installed and I see an Insufficient permission to manipulate /usr/local/bin error, how do I fix it?​ A: This occurs when you do not have ownership of /usr/local/bin. A long-term solution to improve the handling of permissions is in the works. In the meantime, a temporary workaround is to change ownership of /usr/local/bin by running sudo chown $USER /usr/local/bin. When you are able to write to the directory, Rancher Desktop should be able to create the symlinks. From versions 1.3.0 and above, we no longer create symlinks in /usr/local/bin but in ~/.rd/bin and put that directory on the PATH instead, to avoid having to deal with write permissions to /usr/local/bin and file conflicts. We strongly recommend you to upgrade to the latest version of Rancher Desktop. Q: Is Cygwin compatible with Rancher Desktop?​ A: No, but there are plans to add compatibility. Q: How can I add Rancher Desktop to the startup programs list on Windows?​ A: On Windows, you can add a program to startup programs list in a number of ways. For example, you can use the following steps. Press Windows+R to open the Run dialog box.Type shell:startup and then hit Enter to open the Startup folder.Copy &quot;Rancher Desktop&quot; shortcut from Desktop and paste in Startup folder.Restart your machine. Q: Where does Rancher Desktop actually put the data volumes?​ A: Windows:Open Run menu (Press Windows + R) and open the path provided below, depending on the active container runtime. dockerd(moby): \\\\wsl$\\rancher-desktop-data\\var\\lib\\docker\\volumes containerd: \\\\wsl$\\rancher-desktop-data\\var\\lib\\nerdctl\\dbb19c5e\\volumes\\&lt;namespace&gt; macOS &amp; Linux:Navigate to the path provided below in the (lima) VM, depending on the active container runtime. You can use rdctl shell to access these paths in the VM. dockerd(moby): /var/lib/docker/volumes containerd: /var/lib/nerdctl/dbb19c5e/volumes/&lt;namespace&gt; Q: How can I downgrade Rancher Desktop to a non-current (older) release version​ A: We strongly recommend you use the current release version as it has the latest features and bug fixes included. However, if you want to downgrade to an earlier version, please follow the steps below. Perform Troubleshooting &gt; Factory Reset from the current installation. Please make sure the Keep cached Kubernetes images box is not checked in the Factory Reset pop up dialog.Uninstall the current version by following uninstallation instructions for your OS.Install the older version that you need.","keywords":""},{"title":"Deployment Profiles","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"getting-started/deployment","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Preferences values at startup​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Deployment Profiles","url":"getting-started/deployment#preferences-values-at-startup","content":"Rancher Desktop settings are determined as follows: Load &quot;admin&quot; deployment profile (both &quot;defaults&quot; and &quot;locked&quot;)If neither of them exist then load &quot;user&quot; deployment profile (again both &quot;defaults&quot; and &quot;locked&quot;)Load saved preferences from settings.json fileIf there are no saved settings, use the &quot;defaults&quot; profile loaded earlier insteadCopy values from command-line arguments used to launch the app into settingsIf the settings are still completely empty, show the first-run dialogFill any missing values from the builtin application defaultsCopy values from the &quot;locked&quot; profile over the current settings The user cannot modify any settings (via GUI or CLI) that have been locked by the profile.

See below for details. It is also recommended to have: 8 GB of memory4 CPU Additional resources may be required depending on the workloads you plan to run. Ensuring You Have Access to /dev/kvm​ On some distributions (Ubuntu 18.04 for example) the user has insufficient privileges to use /dev/kvm, which is required for Rancher Desktop. To check whether you have the required privileges, do: [ -r /dev/kvm ] &amp;&amp; [ -w /dev/kvm ] || echo 'insufficient privileges'  If it outputs insufficient privileges, you need to add your user to thekvm group. You can do this with: sudo usermod -a -G kvm &quot;$USER&quot;  Then reboot in order to make these changes take effect. pass Setup​ By default, Rancher Desktop uses pass to securely store credentials passed via docker login and nerdctl login. pass requires a small amount of setup if this is the first time it has been used on your machine. If you don't intend to use docker login or nerdctl login you don't have to set uppass - just remember that if you use them in the future, you must set it up or you will run into errors. Once Rancher Desktop is installed, you should create a GPG key. This will be used by pass to secure secrets. You can create a GPG key with: gpg --generate-key  The output should contain something like 8D818FB37A9279E341F01506ED96AD27A40C9C73. This is your key ID. You can then initialize pass by passing this key ID to it: pass init 8D818FB37A9279E341F01506ED96AD27A40C9C73  For more information on pass, please see its website. Traefik Port Binding Access​ Rancher Desktop makes use of Traefik as the default ingress controller. Users may run into a permission denied error after deploying Rancher Desktop due to restricted port access on the Traefik ingress. Most Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu 20.04) do not allow non-root users to listen on TCP and UDP ports below 1024. In order to allow Traefik to listen to privileged ports on the local host, please run the following command: sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80  After the command is run, all ports 80 and above will become unprivileged and Traefik will be able to successfully access said ports. To preserve this change across reboots as a custom kernel parameter setting, add the same command inside your /etc/sysctl.conf file.

"},{"title":"Existing Deployments​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Running When Offline","url":"how-to-guides/running-air-gapped#existing-deployments","content":"If Rancher Desktop has been installed on a machine initially with networked access, it can be run subsequently on that machine after network connectivity has been turned off. The main difference in core functionality is that the list of versions of Kubernetes available in drop-down menus is limited to those versions that have actually been downloaded and stored in the cache. There is a problem using the kubectl client, because of the kuberlr wrapper (Windows users should add the .exe suffix to each executable utility file). In this case, we're discussing a system that was initialized when connected to the internet, but we're about to take the machine offline for future use. Suppose there are three versions of k3s in the rancher-desktop cache. 1.24.3 1.21.14 1.19.16 But suppose that on this system we only ran kubectl when using versions 1.24.3 and 1.21.14. This means that the ~/.kuberlr/PLATFORM-ARCH/ directory ($env:HOMEDRIVE%\\$env:HOMEPATH/.kuberlr/windows-amd64 on Windows) will contain only two files: kubectl1.24.3 kubectl1.21.14 If we go offline and use the UI to switch to Kubernetes 1.19.16, when kubectl is run, the system will fail. The problem is that kubectl is an alias for kuberlr, which will try to download kubectl 1.19.16 and install it in the .kuberlr directory, but won't be able to access it. So in this case, it would be best to prepare a connected system for disconnecting by selecting each available version of Kubernetes currently in the cache, and running kubectl --context rancher-desktop cluster-info to ensure that an appropriate version of the kubectl client is installed. You could install versioned kubectls manually. This is covered in the next section.

There are two directories that need to be populated in order for Rancher Desktop to function off-line: The Cache Directory​ To populate a source disk (which we refer to here as %SOURCEDISK%, although it is probably some kind of removable medium like a USB thumb drive), you need the following files: k3s-versions.json -- this file is created by Rancher Desktop. It reads a raw JSON file from https://update.k3s.io/v1-release/channels and converts it into a different kind of JSON file. Currently there is no utility to do that conversion; the easiest way to get this file is to run Rancher Desktop on a connected system and save the CACHE/k3s-versions.json file (see below for where CACHE exists on different platforms).Tar archives of Kubernetes K3s images. These are listed at https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases. You'll want to download either the k3s-airgap-images-amd64.tar for AMD/Intel machines, k3s-airgap-images-arm64.tar for M1 machines, or the respective *.tar.zst compressed tarball if you are using k3s v1.26.1 and above. Finally you'll need to download the k3s executable for the selected version. For example, the following commands will let you work with K3s v1.24.3 build 1 offline: cd .../CACHE mkdir v1.24.3+k3s1 cd v1.24.3+k3s1 wget https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.24.3%2Bk3s1/k3s-airgap-images-amd64.tar wget https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.24.3%2Bk3s1/sha256sum-amd64.txt wget https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.24.3%2Bk3s1/k3s  WindowsmacOSLinux On Linux, the cache directory is at $HOME/.cache/rancher-desktop and the commands to populate it would be CACHEDIR=$HOME/.cache/rancher-desktop mkdir -p $CACHEDIR/k3s cp $SOURCEDISK/k3s-versions.json $CACHEDIR/ cp -r $SOURCEDISK/v&lt;MAJOR&gt;.&lt;MINOR&gt;.&lt;PATCH&gt;+k3s&lt;BUILD&gt; $CACHEDIR/k3s/  The kuberlr Directory​ The location of this directory is more straightforward. On all platforms, it's at HOME/.kuberlr/PLATFORM-ARCH where: HOME is the home directory: usually $env:HOMEDRIVE%\\$env:HOMEPATH on Windows, and ~ or $HOME on macOS and Linux.PLATFORM is one of windows, linux, or darwin.ARCH is aarch64 on M1 machines, and amd64 everywhere else. To populate it, determine which versions of Kubernetes you'll be using, and download the appropriate executables from the internet. These would be in: WindowsmacOSLinux https://dl.k8s.io/VERSION/bin/PLATFORM/CPU/kubectl Where: VERSION will have the form vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (like v1.22.1),PLATFORM will be one of darwin, linux, or windows,CPU will arm64 on M1 machines and amd64 everywhere else. For example, to get a kubectl for Windows that will work with Kubernetes v1.22, this Windows command-shell (not PowerShell) command will put it on the SOURCEDISK: wget -O %SOURCEDISK/kubectl1.22.1.exe https://dl.k8s.io/v1.22.1/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe  A Note on Versions​ Kubectl clients are guaranteed to work with servers that are running the same MAJOR version and differ in the MINOR version by at most 1. So for example, if your organization is working with Kubernetes versions v1.21.x, v1.22.x, and v1.23.x, for any patch-version of x, you would only need to install kubectl1.22.x in the .kuberlr directory. But if you copy a v1.24.x of Kubernetes into the CACHE directory, you'll need to ensure there's a compatible kubectl in the .kuberlr directory as well (any of v1.23.x, v1.24.x, or v1.25.x would suffice).

Skaffold handles the workflow for building, pushing, and deploying your application, and it provides building blocks for creating CI/CD pipelines. This enables you to focus on iterating on your application locally while Skaffold continuously deploys to your local or remote Kubernetes cluster. To learn more about Skaffold, refer to the project docs here. In order to demonstrate the steps to set up Skaffold with Rancher Desktop, a sample nodejs app example is provided within the Rancher Desktop docs repository here. Important: Skaffold only works with dockerd (Moby). Therefore, make sure to select your runtime as dockerd from the Kubernetes Settings panel in the Rancher Desktop UI. Visit https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/ to install Skaffold. Clone the Rancher Desktop docs repository and navigate to the express-sample in a terminal as follows: cd docs.rancherdesktop.io/assets/express-sample Run skaffold init. Per the Skaffold docs,skaffold init walks through your project directory and looks for any build configuration files such as Dockerfile, build.gradle/pom.xml, package.json, requirements.txt, or go.mod. We will select Dockerfile and package.json in our example. This will generate the initial configuration file that you can modify as needed. When prompted, select yes to write your config to skaffold.yaml. In your editor, review your app.js and manifests.yaml files. Note that in manifests.yaml, you will have a deployment config as well as a service config. It is only necessary to have 1 replica for testing purposes. Back in your terminal, you'll notice that you will have two options: skaffold run that lets you build and deploy, and skaffold dev that allows you to enter development mode with auto-redeploy. We will use skaffold dev in this example. As you will need to have push access to the image repository, you can either use your docker login, or you can set up a local registry: Docker HubLocal Registry Before running skaffold dev, use your docker login if you have a Docker Hub account. Then, in the files skaffold.yaml and manifests.yaml replace matamagu/express-sample for YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/express-sample as skaffold dev will push the built image to DockerHub. As you go through your development, Skaffold will detect any changes and will automatically go through the build and deployment process again. You will be able to see any changes reflected in the cluster.

Q: How can I fix the Docker error when starting a container using the VS Code dev-containers extension with version &gt;v0.266?​ A: There is a current workaround for users experiencing a Docker error when starting a container using the dev-containers extension for VS code versioned v0.266 or later and Rancher Desktop v1.8.1. Disabling Wayland in the user settings will allow the container to spin up successfully. This can be accomplished by unchecking the box in the Settings &gt; Extensions &gt; Dev Containers tab labelled Dev &gt; Containers: Mount Wayland Socket (Applies to All Profiles). Q: Why do I not see my WSL distro under Rancher Desktop's WSL Integration page?​ A: You are likely using a WSL 1 distro. Rancher Desktop supports only WSL 2 distros. You can convert your WSL 1 distro into a WSL 2 distro by running the command wsl --set-version &lt;distro-name&gt; 2. You can also run the command wsl --set-default-version 2 to set all the future distributions you might install to use WSL 2. Q: I do not see an entry for Rancher Desktop when running kubectl config get-contexts, where is it?​ A: Rancher Desktop places its configuration in the default location, ~/.kube/config, and uses that. Your KUBECONFIG environment variable may be set to look elsewhere for configuration files. Q: Rancher Desktop is stuck on Waiting for Kubernetes API, what do I do?​ A: The cause is hard to determine without additional information. Navigate to the Troubleshooting tab and use the button to access the logs. Then go to the Rancher Desktop GitHub page and file an issue with the logs attached. Q: I can no longer run docker compose after installing Rancher Desktop and uninstalling Docker Desktop, what happened?​ A: This was an issue related to earlier versions (prior to 1.1.0) of Rancher Desktop. Rancher Desktop version 1.1.0 and above comes bundled with docker-compose for you, and makes the cli plugins available at ~/.docker/cli-plugins. We strongly recommend you to be on the latest version of Rancher Desktop. If you still don't see docker-compose available then please file a bug on Github. Q: I'm using Homebrew to install Rancher Desktop, but brew install rancher-desktop is failing, why?​ A: Due to the Homebrew cask naming conventions, the -desktop suffix is dropped from the cask formula name. Use brew install rancher instead. Q: How do I fix permission denied errors when trying to use Docker on WSL?​ A: You need write-permission to access the docker socket. There are many ways to go about that, but this is one of the more common approaches. Using the Ubuntu WSL command-line: sudo groupadd docker sudo adduser $USER docker sudo chown root:docker /var/run/docker.sock sudo chmod g+w /var/run/docker.sock newgrp docker Q: How do I fix kubectl: command not found issue on Linux?​ A: By default, Rancher Desktop creates symlinks of kubectl, docker, helm and nerdctl binaries in the /home/&lt;user&gt;/.local/bin directory on Linux. To be able to call these commands directly from the console you may add the directory to your PATH environment variable by executing the following command in console and performing logout and login: echo &quot;export PATH=\\$PATH:/home/$(whoami)/.local/bin&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc Q: How do I fix FATA[0005] subnet 10.4.0.0/24 overlaps with other one on this address space when running a container using nerdctl run?​ A: You will see this error if there's a route rule with an IP address from a conflicting subnet on the Iptables. The conflicting routes could be either from the host network (bridge mode) or the Kubernetes network. A quick workaround to this issue is to shutdown WSL via the command wsl --shutdown. ⚠️ Please note that shutting down WSL will stop all other distros along with the rancher-desktop distro. Q: How do I fix the Installation Aborted error while downgrading from an existing MSI installation to an older EXE version (1.6.x or earlier) on Windows?​ A: You will see this error if the Windows registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventLog\\Application\\RancherDesktopPrivilegedService that is supposed to be deleted during the MSI uninstallation process is not deleted for some reason. Please manually delete the registry key and try installing the EXE version. You can run the below command in a privileged shell to delete the registry key. reg.exe delete HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventLog\\Application\\RancherDesktopPrivilegedService /reg:64 /f Q: Why do I see a blank screen when I launch the Cluster Dashboard?​ A: The Cluster Dashboard may not be running correctly because another process on your machine is using ports 9080 or 9443 that the Dashboard process (steve) depends on. To solve this, identify and terminate the process using those ports. You can use the command below to identify processes using a specific port on your host machine. Note that on macOS and Linux, the Rancher Dashboard process is named steve, while on Windows, it's steve.exe. If steve is the only process using ports 9080 or 9443, do not terminate it.

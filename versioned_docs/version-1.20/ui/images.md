The **Images** tab allows you to manage local container images via the application Graphical User Interface. Depending on the container engine selected, the options include:

- Building container images from a local Dockerfile.
- Pull images from a registry and push images to a registry.
- Delete, and scan local images.

To view how to manage container images using the command line, refer to the [Images section](../tutorials/working-with-images.md) in the Tutorials.

### Image Management Options

- `Delete`: This option is only available using the container engine `dockerd (moby)`. Images can be selected from the display view and deleted using the `Delete` button.

- `All Images`: This option is only available using the container engine `containerd (nerdctl)` and `k8s.io` namespace. This checkbox can be marked to list all images including default application images in the `Rancher` resource group.

- `Namespace`: This option is only available using the container engine `containerd (nerdctl)`. You can select a specific namespace in the cluster via the dropdown, which will then display the associated images.

- `Filter`: Accepts either text or numbered input to display filtered images.

### Scanning Images

This feature uses [Trivy] to scan your images for vulnerabilities and configuration issues.

To scan an image:

1. From the image list, find the image you want to scan.
1. Click **â‹® > Scan**.
1. A summary of the vulnerabilities, sorted by the level of severity, are displayed.
1. Click **>** to view the details of each vulnerability, including reference links to learn more about the particular vulnerability.

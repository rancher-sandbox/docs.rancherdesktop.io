#### Configure PATH

A Rancher Desktop installation comes with command-line utilities that are used to interface with its various features. Some examples of these utilities are `docker`, `nerdctl`, `kubectl`, and `helm`. These utilities are located in `~/.rd/bin` - you may see which utilities are included in your installation by running `ls ~/.rd/bin`.

In order to use the utilities, `~/.rd/bin` must be in the `PATH` variable in your shell.

There are two options for doing this:

- **Automatic**: `PATH` management will add `~/.rd/bin` to your `PATH` by modifying your shell .rc files for you.
- **Manual**: `PATH` management does not change anything - in this mode, you must add `~/.rd/bin` to your `PATH` yourself.

Rancher Desktop can be used with [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/) to execute ephemeral tests and containers that work inside Docker. This guide demonstrates the use of Testcontainers with a sample repository.

### Prerequisites

[Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/) can only be used with the `moby (dockerd)` runtime as it requires a Docker-API compatible container runtime. Kubernetes must be disabled for machines on Apple Silicon. The setting can be disabled via the **Preferences > Kubernetes** dialog, or by using the `rdctl` command below:

```bash
rdctl set --kubernetes-enabled=false
```

 Please also ensure that [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) is installed on your machine in order to make use of the [`mvn verify`](https://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html) command.

You can download a sample test repository in the `testcontainers-java-repro` located here: https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java-repro

After the repository is downloaded, please navigate to the `testcontainers-java-repro` folder and run the command `mvn verify`.

```bash
mvn verify
```

After the command has been run, you should see a `BUILD SUCCESS` with test statistics for failures, number of tests ran, skipped tests, time elapsed, and errors.

Currently, workarounds are needed for using Testcontainers on macOS M1 machines. Below are methods for using Testcontainers on either runtime, depending on administrative access.

#### [QEMU](../ui/preferences/virtual-machine/emulation.md#qemu)

<details>
<summary>Workaround Summary</summary>

This runtime can be used with administrative access enabled which can be set via the [**Preferences > Application > General**](../ui/preferences/application/general.md) dialog. This will ensure that routable IP's are allocated.

Next, export the virtual machine port explicitly using the command below:

```bash
export TESTCONTAINERS_HOST_OVERRIDE=$(rdctl shell ip a show rd0 | awk '/inet / {sub("/.*",""); print $2}')
```

</details>

#### [VZ](../ui/preferences/virtual-machine/emulation.md#vz)

<details>
<summary>Workaround Summary</summary>

This runtime can be used with administrative access enabled which can be set via the [**Preferences > Application > General**](../ui/preferences/application/general.md) dialog. This will ensure that routable IP's are allocated.

Next, export the virtual machine port explicitly using the command below:

```bash
export TESTCONTAINERS_HOST_OVERRIDE=$(rdctl shell ip a show vznat | awk '/inet / {sub("/.*",""); print $2}')
```

For `VZ` virtual machines, you can also use Testcontainers without the need for administrative access by exporting the settings below:

```bash
export DOCKER_HOST=unix://$HOME/.rd/docker.sock
export TESTCONTAINERS_DOCKER_SOCKET_OVERRIDE=/var/run/docker.sock
export TESTCONTAINERS_HOST_OVERRIDE=$(rdctl shell ip a show vznat | awk '/inet / {sub("/.*",""); print $2}')
```

</details>

After the respective virtual machine settings have been applied, and the repository is downloaded, please navigate to the `testcontainers-java-repro` folder and run the command `mvn verify`.

```shell
mvn verify
```

After the command has been run, you should see a `BUILD SUCCESS` with test statistics for failures, number of tests ran, skipped tests, time elapsed, and errors.

<TabItem value="Intel">

After the repository is downloaded, please navigate to the `testcontainers-java-repro` folder and run the command `mvn verify`.

```shell
mvn verify
```

After the command has been run, you should see a `BUILD SUCCESS` with test statistics for failures, number of tests ran, skipped tests, time elapsed, and errors.

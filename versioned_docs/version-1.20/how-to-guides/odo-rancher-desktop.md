title: ODO and Rancher Desktop
---

`odo` is a fast, iterative and straightforward CLI tool for developers who write, build, and deploy applications on Kubernetes. The `odo` CLI abstracts away complex Kubernetes concepts and allows developers to focus on iterating code. The helper tool can detect changes to local code and deploy them to a container orchestrated cluster automatically, giving instant feedback to validate changes in real-time. Please refer to the [`odo` project documentation](https://odo.dev/docs/introduction) to learn more.

## Prerequisites

For this guide you will use the [express-sample node.js application](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/docs.rancherdesktop.io/tree/main/assets/express-sample) in the [Rancher Desktop documentation](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/docs.rancherdesktop.io) repository as a way to demonstrate the use of `odo` and Rancher Desktop.

:::note
`odo` works with the `dockerd (moby)` runtime, be sure to have it selected from the preferences dialog location *Preferences* > *Container Engine* > *Allowed Images*.
:::

Please ensure that Kubernetes is enabled for your application. Additionally, in order to use `odo deploy`, you will need to be able to build and push an image to a Docker container registry. Log in using your Docker credentials as noted below:

```shell
$ docker login docker.io
Username:
Password:
Login Succeeded!
```

### Installation

Install `odo` by visiting https://odo.dev/docs/overview/installation and perform the appropriate install for your platform. The tool can be used both as a [CLI tool](https://odo.dev/docs/overview/installation#cli-installation) or an [IDE plugin](https://odo.dev/docs/overview/installation#ide-installation), as well as a few [alternative install methods](https://odo.dev/docs/overview/installation#alternative-installation-methods) depending on your preference. This guide will focus on using the tool through the CLI.

## Steps: `odo init`

This command will initialize the application by creating a `devfile.yaml` for deployments.

1. Clone the [Rancher Desktop documentation](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/docs.rancherdesktop.io) repository and change your directory to the [sample-express](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/docs.rancherdesktop.io/tree/main/assets/express-sample) application.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/docs.rancherdesktop.io.git
cd docs.rancherdesktop.io/assets/express-sample
```

2. Before initializing, you must connect `odo` to your cluster via a namespace, which can be created with the command [`odo create namespace <name>`](https://odo.dev/docs/command-reference/create-namespace):

```shell
odo create namespace odo-dev
```

<details>
<summary>Sample Output</summary>

```shell
$ odo create namespace odo-dev
 ✓  Creating the namespace "odo-dev" [5ms]
 ✓  Namespace "odo-dev" is ready for use
 ✓  New namespace created and now using namespace: odo-dev
```

</details>

3. The command [`odo init`](https://odo.dev/docs/command-reference/init) will auto-detect your project framework and choose the appropriate `devfile.yaml` to be used for deployment of your application. The command will allow you to confirm the Devfile (Y/n), select a container to change configuration (choose none for this example), and enter a component name (e.g. my-nodejs-app).

  Alternatively, the following command with the additional flags (e.g. `--devfile-version 2.2.0`) can be used to initialize `odo` and allow your application to be deployed:

```shell
odo init --name my-nodejs-app --devfile nodejs --devfile-registry DefaultDevfileRegistry --devfile-version 2.2.0
```

<details>
<summary>Sample Output</summary>

```shell
  __
 /  \__     Initializing a new component
 \__/  \    
 /  \__/    odo version: v3.13.0
 \__/

 ✓  Downloading devfile "nodejs:2.2.0" from registry "DefaultDevfileRegistry" [1s]

Your new component 'my-nodejs-app' is ready in the current directory.
To start editing your component, use 'odo dev' and open this folder in your favorite IDE.
Changes will be directly reflected on the cluster.
```

</details>

```shell
odo init
```

<details>
<summary>Sample Output</summary>

```shell
$ odo init
  __
 /  \__     Initializing a new component
 \__/  \    Files: Source code detected, a Devfile will be determined based upon source code autodetection

 \__/

Interactive mode enabled, please answer the following questions:
 ✓  Determining a Devfile for the current directory [910ms]
Based on the files in the current directory odo detected
Language: JavaScript
Project type: Node.js
Application ports: 3000
The devfile "nodejs:2.1.1" from the registry "DefaultDevfileRegistry" will be downloaded.
? Is this correct? Yes
 ✓  Downloading devfile "nodejs:2.1.1" from registry "DefaultDevfileRegistry" [933ms]

↪ Container Configuration "runtime":
  OPEN PORTS:
    - 3000
    - 5858
  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
    - DEBUG_PORT = 5858

? Select container for which you want to change configuration? NONE - configuration is correct
? Enter component name: my-nodejs-app

You can automate this command by executing:
   odo init --name my-nodejs-app --devfile nodejs --devfile-registry DefaultDevfileRegistry --devfile-version 2.1.1

Your new component 'my-nodejs-app' is ready in the current directory.
To start editing your component, use 'odo dev' and open this folder in your favorite IDE.
Changes will be directly reflected on the cluster.
```

</details>

## Steps: `odo dev`

Now, you can run the command [`odo dev`](https://odo.dev/docs/command-reference/dev) to continuously deploy applications as you make changes to your code through your preferred IDE.

:::caution
You may run into an `ErrImagePull` error as the image may not be covered by Rancher Desktop's allowed images list. To resolve the error, please add the necessary image in *Preferences* > *Container Engine* > *Allowed Images* and hit apply to update allowed images immediately.

```shell
odo dev
```

</details>

The `express-sample` application can now be accessed by the local port (127.0.0.1:20001). As an example, you can make a text change to the `index.jade` file in the *views* folder to see a real-time update to the application.

## Steps: `odo deploy`

This command will deploy your application to your cluster with instructions from your `devfile.yaml`.

1. Be sure to be logged into the Docker container registry to push the application to, and set your container image build arguments to be the same as your container architecture using the [`ODO_IMAGE_BUILD_ARGS`](https://odo.dev/docs/overview/configure/#environment-variables-controlling-odo-behavior:~:text=ODO_IMAGE_BUILD_ARGS) environment variable:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="AMD64">

```shell
export ODO_IMAGE_BUILD_ARGS="--platform=linux/amd64"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ARM">

```shell
export ODO_IMAGE_BUILD_ARGS="--platform=linux/arm64"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. Update the `Dockerfile` in the `express-sample` directory to containerize the application with correct variables in order to build and push to a registry:

<details>
<summary>Sample Dockerfile</summary>

```shell
# Install the app dependencies in a full SLE Node image
FROM registry.suse.com/bci/nodejs:16

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install app dependencies
RUN npm install --production

# Install app dependencies
COPY . /opt/app-root/src

ENV NODE_ENV production
ENV PORT 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

</details>

3. Modify the `devfile.yaml` to the example noted below for your container cluster.

* Update the variables to access your container registry:

```yaml
# Add the following variables code anywhere in devfile.yaml
# This MUST be a container registry you are able to access
variables:
  CONTAINER_IMAGE: docker.io/<INSERTUSERNAME>/nodejs-odo-example
  RESOURCE_NAME: my-nodejs-app
  CONTAINER_PORT: "3000"
  DOMAIN_NAME: nodejs.example.com
```

* Update the Devfile schema to `2.2.0` as `odo deploy` makes use of this version. Additionally, there is a command to initialize `odo` with the correct `schemaVersion: 2.2.0` noted above in the installation:

```yaml
# Deploy "kind" ID's use schema 2.2.0+
schemaVersion: 2.2.0
```

* The commands seen below are used for deployment activities:

<details>
<summary>Deployment Commands</summary>

```yaml
# This is the main "composite" command that will run all below commands
commands:
- id: deploy
  composite:
    commands:
    - build-image
    - k8s-deployment
    - k8s-service
    - k8s-url
    group:
      isDefault: true
      kind: deploy

# Below are the commands and their respective components that they are "linked" to deploy
- id: build-image
  apply:
    component: outerloop-build

- id: k8s-service
  apply:

</details>

* The commands seen below are used for adding the Docker image location, K8s deployment and services to `components`:

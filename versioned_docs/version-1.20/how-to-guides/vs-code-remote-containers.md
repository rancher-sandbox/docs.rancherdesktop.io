The [Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers] extension lets you use a Docker container as a full-featured development environment, which helps ensure a consistent environment across developer machines and makes it easy for new team members and contributors to get up and running. Since Rancher Desktop supports Docker CLI via [Moby], you can use the Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers extension out-of-the-box.

### Steps to try a sample dev container

1. Install and launch Rancher Desktop. Select `dockerd (moby)` as the Container Runtime from the `Kubernetes Settings` menu.

4. After the extension is installed, you will see the extension item in the side bar, and a green button at the lower left corner to show the command palette with various options/commands related to `Remote Development`.

5. Microsoft provides a number of sample dev containers at this GitHub repository: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers.git. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers.git
```

6. Press `F1` to bring up a search bar on the command pallette to query for available commands. Begin to type in "Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container..." and click on the command `Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...`. Browse to one of the samples in the cloned respository, e.g., `javascript-node`.

7. On selecting a sample, you will see the progress notification  ![](../img/vscoderemotecontainers/vscode-remotedevelopment-containerprogress.png) while the container is being loaded, and once the container is successfully started, the bottom left corner shows the container name. ![](../img/vscoderemotecontainers/vscode-remotedevelopment-containersuccess.png)

8. Once the container is started, Press `F5` in the VS Code IDE to start the sample application. You will see that the application is started and served on `localhost:3000`.

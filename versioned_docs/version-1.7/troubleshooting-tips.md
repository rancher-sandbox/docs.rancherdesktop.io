title: Troubleshooting Tips
---

This page provides tips to troubleshoot issues you may have with Rancher Desktop.

#### Q: Why do I not see my WSL distro under Rancher Desktop's WSL Integration page?

**A:** You are likely using a WSL 1 distro. Rancher Desktop supports only WSL 2 distros. You can convert your WSL 1 distro into a WSL 2 distro by running the command `wsl --set-version <distro-name> 2`. You can also run the command `wsl --set-default-version 2` to set all the future distributions you might install to use WSL 2.

#### Q: I do not see an entry for Rancher Desktop when running `kubectl config get-contexts`, where is it?

**A:** Rancher Desktop places its configuration in the default location, `~/.kube/config,` and uses that. Your `KUBECONFIG` environment variable may be set to look elsewhere for configuration files.

#### Q: Rancher Desktop is stuck on `Waiting for Kubernetes API`, what do I do?

**A:** The cause is hard to determine without additional information. Navigate to the Troubleshooting tab and use the button to access the logs. Then go to the [Rancher Desktop GitHub] page and file an issue with the logs attached.

<!-- RD #1262 -->
#### Q: I can no longer run `docker compose` after installing Rancher Desktop and uninstalling Docker Desktop, what happened?

**A:** This was an issue related to earlier versions (prior to 1.1.0) of Rancher Desktop.  Rancher Desktop version 1.1.0 and above comes bundled with `docker-compose` for you, and makes the cli plugins available at `~/.docker/cli-plugins`. We strongly recommend you to be on the latest version of Rancher Desktop.

If you still don't see `docker-compose` available then please file a bug on [Github](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-desktop/issues/new?assignees=&labels=kind%2Fbug&template=bug_report.yml).

#### Q: I'm using Homebrew to install Rancher Desktop, but `brew install rancher-desktop` is failing, why?

**A:** Due to the Homebrew cask naming conventions, the `-desktop` suffix is dropped from the cask formula name. Use `brew install rancher` instead.

#### Q: How do I fix `permission denied` errors when trying to use Docker on WSL?

**A:** You need write-permission to access the docker socket. There are many ways to go about that, but this is one of the more common approaches. Using the Ubuntu WSL command-line:

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo adduser $USER docker
sudo chown root:docker /var/run/docker.sock
sudo chmod g+w /var/run/docker.sock
newgrp docker
```

#### Q: How do I fix `kubectl: command not found` issue on Linux?

**A:** By default, Rancher Desktop creates symlinks of `kubectl`, `docker`, `helm` and `nerdctl` binaries in the `/home/<user>/.local/bin` directory on Linux. To be able to call these commands directly from the console you may add the directory to your `PATH` environment variable by executing the following command in console and performing logout and login:

```bash
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:/home/$(whoami)/.local/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
```
#### Q: How do I fix `FATA[0005] subnet 10.4.0.0/24 overlaps with other one on this address space` when running a container using `nerdctl run`?

**A:** You will see this error if there's a route rule with an IP address from a conflicting subnet on the Iptables. The conflicting routes could be either from the host network (bridge mode) or the Kubernetes network. A quick workaround to this issue is to shutdown WSL via the command `wsl --shutdown`. 

**:warning: Please note that shutting down WSL will stop all other distros along with the `rancher-desktop` distro.**

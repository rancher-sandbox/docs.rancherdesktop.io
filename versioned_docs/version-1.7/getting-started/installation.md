### Requirements

- Running on a machine with [virtualization capabilities].
- Persistent internet connection.

[Windows Subsystem for Linux]:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10

[virtualization capabilities]:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting#error-0x80370102-the-virtual-machine-could-not-be-started-because-a-required-feature-is-not-installed

It is also recommended to have:

- 8 GB of memory
- 4 CPU

Additional resources may be required depending on the workloads you plan to run.

**Note:** You can use Rancher Desktop as a Non-Admin user on a Windows machine. However, an Admin's intervention is required during the installation process for the below components.

- **WSL2 - ** You need Admin privileges to install WSL2, which is an essential component of Rancher Desktop.
- **Rancher Desktop Privileged Service - ** You need Admin privileges to install the Rancher Desktop privileged service, which is required to expose applications/services, running inside containers, on all interfaces on the host machine. However, you can skip the installation of the Rancher Desktop Privileged Service with the limitation that you will not be able to expose applications/services on any interface except `127.0.0.1`.

### Installing Rancher Desktop on Windows

1. Go to the [releases page] on GitHub.
1. Find the version of Rancher Desktop you want to download.
1. Expand the **Assets** section and download the Windows installer. It will be called `Rancher.Desktop.Setup.X.Y.Z.msi`, where `X.Y.Z` is the version of Rancher Desktop.
1. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the installer to and run the installer. This will usually be the `Downloads` folder.
1. Review the License Agreement and click **I Agree** to proceed with the installation.
1. If prompted, choose between installing for everyone on the machine or installing
   just for the current user.  Installing for everyone is preferred in order to
   install the Rancher Desktop Privileged Service, as noted above.
1. Follow the prompts to confirm installation.
1. When the installation completes, click **Finish** to close the installation wizard.

## Linux

### Requirements

Rancher Desktop requires the following on Linux:

- A distribution that can install .deb or .rpm packages, or AppImages.
- A persistent internet connection.
- An x86_64 processor with either AMD-V or VT-x.
- Read-write access on `/dev/kvm`. See below for details.

It is also recommended to have:

- 8 GB of memory
- 4 CPU

Additional resources may be required depending on the workloads you plan to run.


### Ensuring You Have Access to `/dev/kvm`

On some distributions (Ubuntu 18.04 for example) the user has insufficient
privileges to use `/dev/kvm`, which is required for Rancher Desktop.
To check whether you have the required privileges, do:

```
[ -r /dev/kvm ] && [ -w /dev/kvm ] || echo 'insufficient privileges'
```

If it outputs `insufficient privileges`, you need to add your user to the
`kvm` group. You can do this with:

```
sudo usermod -a -G kvm "$USER"
```

Then reboot in order to make these changes take effect.


### `pass` Setup

By default, Rancher Desktop uses `pass` to securely store credentials
passed via `docker login` and `nerdctl login`. `pass` requires a small amount
of setup if this is the first time it has been used on your machine. If you don't
intend to use `docker login` or `nerdctl login` you don't have to set up
`pass` - just remember that if you use them in the future, you must set it
up or you will run into errors.

Once Rancher Desktop is installed, you should create a GPG key. This will be
used by `pass` to secure secrets. You can create a GPG key with:

```
gpg --generate-key
```

The output should contain something like `8D818FB37A9279E341F01506ED96AD27A40C9C73`.
This is your key ID. You can then initialize `pass` by passing this key ID to it:

```
pass init 8D818FB37A9279E341F01506ED96AD27A40C9C73
```

For more information on `pass`, please see [its website].

### Installation via .deb Package

Add the Rancher Desktop repository and install Rancher Desktop with:

```
curl -s https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/isv:/Rancher:/stable/deb/Release.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo dd status=none of=/usr/share/keyrings/isv-rancher-stable-archive-keyring.gpg
echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/isv-rancher-stable-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/isv:/Rancher:/stable/deb/ ./' | sudo dd status=none of=/etc/apt/sources.list.d/isv-rancher-stable.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install rancher-desktop
```


### Uninstalling .deb Package

You can remove the package, repository, and key with:

```
sudo apt remove --autoremove rancher-desktop
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/isv-rancher-stable.list
sudo rm /usr/share/keyrings/isv-rancher-stable-archive-keyring.gpg
sudo apt update
```


### Installing via .rpm Package

Note: RHEL, Fedora, and related distributions package QEMU, which Rancher Desktop
uses on Linux, differently than other distributions. To use Rancher Desktop on these
distributions, please use the AppImage.

To add the repository and install on openSUSE:

```
sudo zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/isv:/Rancher:/stable/rpm/isv:Rancher:stable.repo
sudo zypper install rancher-desktop
```


### Uninstalling .rpm Package

Ensure that Rancher Desktop has exited (if not, it should appear in the dock) and do:

```
sudo zypper remove --clean-deps rancher-desktop
sudo zypper removerepo isv_Rancher_stable
```


### Installing via AppImage

First, ensure that `pass` and `gpg` are installed. For example, on Fedora:

```
dnf install pass gnupg2
```

You may download the AppImage [here]. In order to run it, simply make it executable
and execute it. For better integration with your desktop, you may use [AppImageLauncher].

[here]:
https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/isv:/Rancher:/stable/AppImage/rancher-desktop-latest-x86_64.AppImage
[AppImageLauncher]:
https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher


### Uninstalling AppImage

Simply delete the AppImage. That's it!
